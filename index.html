			 <p>The closest thing I have to synesthesia is a perpetual desire to find the volume of music that &ldquo;fills&rdquo; my ears. It&rsquo;s an indescribable and elusive point that&rsquo;s pretty loud, but not <em>very loud</em>.</p>

			 <p>Happy December, and happy <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2022">Advent of Code</a>. As per my tradition, I&rsquo;m trying to learn a new language. Since I enjoyed the functional-ish aspects of Kotlin so much last year, I decided to try a fully functional language this year: Haskell. And oh boy was day one a challenge!</p>
<p>Follow my progress <a href="https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2022">at my Github repo</a></p>

			 <p>I just deactivated my Twitter accounts: @Plutor and 9 bots. So long, fucko.</p>
<p>One bot I can&rsquo;t get into because I can&rsquo;t get the emailed confirmation code. And another was apparently suspended for some reason I don&rsquo;t care to investigate and you have to <em>appeal the suspension in order to deactivate the account</em>.</p>

			 <p>This is my new calendar idea, the spool calendar. The spool currently goes until the first week of Feb 2023, each week I can just pull it upwards and cut off the excess.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The biggest problems to resolve for the next prototype are 1) make it easier to mount and feed the spool, and 2) how to keep it from rolling back up (I&rsquo;ve got it sorta taped there right now, but some sort of little clip might be better)</p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s about 14x10 right now but it should probably be more like 18x16, the days are a little cramped and a squarer 5-week layout is more typical for calendars</p>

			 <p>In June 1976, aliens landed on a quiet farm in northern Wisconsin. Three of them left their ship and walked a couple hundred yards to the farmhouse. When the farmer answered the door, they were shocked to discover that we didn&rsquo;t look like aliens. We looked just like them. After a brief discussion, the landing party decided this wouldn&rsquo;t make a very good press release.</p>
<p>They went back to their ship and left to find a planet with more exotic looking aliens, and have never returned.</p>

			 <p>The scariest part of my commute has bike lanes now, but I&rsquo;m not totally sure if it&rsquo;s in improvement. Part of Cambridge St in Boston is wonderful (separated by plastic posts close to City Hall), but other parts are weird (no separation) or bad (the Blue Bikes in front of Whole Foods is.. IN THE BIKE LANE!?), and the pavement is still a potholed disaster.</p>
<p>And after biking in Chicago a couple weeks ago, I really wish this city had dedicated bike traffic signals.</p>
