And a story slowly unfolds, from lots of different perspectives.</p>

			 <p>In 2005, I went to E3 with a small handful of friends. I wanted to blog a bit from the floor, but didn&rsquo;t want to go through what would have been a <em>huge</em> hassle to use a laptop. So I set up a system that we could all send emails to with our phones and it would save the text and annotate it with the author&rsquo;s name based on phone numbers. I called it a &ldquo;moblog&rdquo;. This was 10 months before the first Tweet, and 16 months before Twitter became publicly available. We probably wrote all of this with T9.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of what we moblogged for E3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plutor: The new e3 blogging system is now online. (13 May, 08:36AM)</li>
<li>Nomad: I&rsquo;m at E3! Just kidding I&rsquo;m at crappy work. (13 May, 10:29AM)</li>
<li>Nomad: Whoever invented getting 4 hovrs of sleep should be shot (17 May, 05:54AM)</li>
<li>Chris: We&rsquo;re on our way and we&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->already<!-- raw HTML omitted --> had at least 3 arguments. This is going to be the best trip evar!! (17 May, 06:19AM)</li>
<li>Chris: Logan just mentioned that for what we&rsquo;re paying for this trip, we could buy a ton of video games. Shut up logan. (17 May, 06:29AM)</li>
<li>Plutor: Boarding takes so long. So inefficient. (17 May, 09:13AM)</li>
<li>Nomad: First coast! (17 May, 06:04PM)</li>
<li>Chris: After the flight I had significant hearing loss which still hasn&rsquo;t come back. (17 May, 06:21PM)</li>
<li>Nomad: In in n out (17 May, 07:17PM)</li>
<li>Nomad: LA train stations are clean by train station standards (17 May, 08:53PM)</li>
<li>Nomad: Dancing girls = good video games (18 May, 02:05PM)</li>
<li>Plutor: Two hours in and i&rsquo;ve already overloaded. Hungry, tired, amazed, and excited for more. (18 May, 02:55PM)</li>
<li>Chris: All the xbox 360 games are running off of apple G5s (18 May, 05:19PM)</li>
<li>Nomad: At the MeFi meetup everyone is cool! (18 May, 10:53PM)</li>
<li>Plutor: This mefi meetup is really cool. Los angeles is the bomb. (19 May, 12:27AM)</li>
<li>Plutor: The xbox 360 controller is so amazing. (19 May, 01:29PM)</li>
<li>Nomad: The workout room has tvs on every treadmill &amp; bike! (19 May, 09:35PM)</li>
<li>Nomad: Controls are broke on mine though (19 May, 09:36PM)</li>
<li>Plutor: We&rsquo;re going early today so we can be first in line for the new zelda. The line was &gt; 2 hours yesterday. (20 May, 11:11AM)</li>
<li>Chris: Brian and I just met the voice of Mario! (20 May, 12:33PM)</li>
<li>Nomad: The last of e3&rsquo;s children is back in the northeast. I love New York (22 May, 09:24PM)</li>

			 <p>Here is calendar prototype 2</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(This is what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->prototype 1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looked like.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been living with this new, larger calendar for a couple weeks now. It&rsquo;s got 5 weeks instead of 4, and the days are 50% larger. I even used posterninja.com to get a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long printed spool<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that&rsquo;ll last until October. But it&rsquo;s not perfect yet, here&rsquo;s a few notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The font is too small to be read from a comfortable distance (the PDF linked above corrects this)</li>
<li>The top bezel is too small</li>
<li>The spool is a little too close to the bottom edge, it&rsquo;s a struggle to advance the calendar (although this will less of a problem after a few weeks).</li>
<li>Poster Ninja was the best site I could find that would print something big on normal paper (not just card stock), but the max height wasn&rsquo;t enough to print a full year. The PDF above is corrected to two pages: Jan-July and July-Jan.</li>
</ol>

			 <p>If you woke up tomorrow the only human on Earth and also immortal, where would be the best place to live? Cities wouldn&rsquo;t be particularly safe because buildings will eventually collapse. You want to be near water and long growing seasons and fertile soil. You want to be far from hurricanes or monsoons or earthquakes. You might want to be near fishing opportunities and existing farm animal populations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising that a very good answer is &ldquo;where the densest forests in the world are&rdquo;. What is surprising to me is that a lot of Europe has a good case, too. In terms of getting started, existing farmland in Europe (there&rsquo;s a lot of it) or newly-cleared land in the Amazon (also a lot of that, sadly) might be the best bets. I&rsquo;d be afraid of the maintenance necessary to keep the Amazon at bay, but on the other hand intercontinental travel with no other living humans is bound to be a challenge.</p>

			 <p>Like last year, I played a <em>bit</em> of video games in 2022, almost all on PC. Early in the year, I dropped Stadia and switched to PC Game Pass. I loved Stadia&rsquo;s technology, but the game selection on Game Pass is shockingly good. And everyone knew it was just a matter of time until Stadia was killed.</p>
<p>I again spent most of my gaming playing co-op with my brother. My favorite game of the year was absolutely We Were Here Forever &ndash; the fourth in that series. They stepped up the visuals and the story and the puzzles this time around, I was very very impressed with it. Other good games we played this year: BBQ Simulator, Biped, Unrailed, You Suck At Parking, Deep Rock Galactic, and Grounded. We also continue to get <em>tons</em> of playtime from Escape Simulator, thanks to two great DLC releases and a very active map building community.</p>
<p>When I was playing alone, I was typically churning through Vampire Survivors, but occasionally also the Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels DLC and Trackmania 2020. I also got my Playdate just a week ago, and I&rsquo;m excited to play through those Season 1 games in the coming months.</p>

			 <p>This is my new calendar idea, the spool calendar. The spool currently goes until the first week of Feb 2023, each week I can just pull it upwards and cut off the excess.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The biggest problems to resolve for the next prototype are 1) make it easier to mount and feed the spool, and 2) how to keep it from rolling back up (I&rsquo;ve got it sorta taped there right now, but some sort of little clip might be better)</p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s about 14x10 right now but it should probably be more like 18x16, the days are a little cramped and a squarer 5-week layout is more typical for calendars</p>

After a brief discussion, the landing party decided this wouldn&rsquo;t make a very good press release.</p>

<p>In 2010, I was a web developer and manager at a small company outside of Boston. Now, I&rsquo;m a developer and team lead at a very very large international company. In 2010, I programmed in mostly Java and Perl. Now, it&rsquo;s mostly Go and C++.</p>

Now, I live in South Boston in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->different<!-- raw HTML omitted --> condo that I own with a large back yard (for this neighborhood at least). In 2010, I lived with my beautiful wife and beautiful dog Gus. Gus isn&rsquo;t with us anymore, but we&rsquo;ve got two adorable toddlers that keep us busy instead.</p>
<p>In 2010, my parents lived in an RV on the road. Now, they only live <!-- raw HTML omitted -->half of the time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in their RV on the road, and the other half of the year they spend in a small home in an &ldquo;RV resort&rdquo; in Florida.</p>
<p>In 2010, I was active on MetaFilter, Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Now, I still visit those websites but of them I&rsquo;m really only active on Twitter. In 2010 I had a personal website, and despite reports to the contrary I still do.</p>

			 <p>Back in 2013, I had a conversation with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cmatta<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about what I thought was the scary inevitable future of streaming companies vertically integrating into content producers. I kept meaning to write up a blog entry. Here we are, now, 6 years later, and the future I saw is now the present, so I will just copy and paste some excerpts from the conversation, and you&rsquo;ll just have to believe I was as prescient as I claim I was.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Picture a world where Comcast made some shows and RCN made other shows and each one of a dozen cable companies each made their own shows</p>
<p>And none of them carried each others shows</p>
<p>That world would be really terrible</p>
<p>Instead of actual openness, it&rsquo;s just a different kind of closedness, and it&rsquo;s about the same amount of money but a lot more annoying</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only Netflix and Hulu right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extrapolating out a decade</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be dozens of these providers all with mutually exclusive shows and streaming mechanisms</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a nightmare for the user</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be saving like 10%</p>
<p>It depends on what I think Netflix and Hulu and Amazon are going to do as these things get more popular, and I don&rsquo;t think it is &ldquo;cooperate&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll have to have 20 different accounts to watch the one good show on each of the 20 distributors</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be paying about the same &ndash; $40-80 a month, but it&rsquo;ll be harder because you&rsquo;re paying a bunch of different places<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And the punchline:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>me: I will, you&rsquo;re ON, MATTA<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I post this now, because there&rsquo;s now not just Netflix and Hulu and Amazon, all with great exclusive originals, but also CBS All Access if you want to watch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Trek Discovery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->upcoming Picard show<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And HBO Now for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Game of Thrones<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->soon you&rsquo;ll need Disney+<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you want to watch anything Marvel or Star Wars or Fox (like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Simpsons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Futurama<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple is getting into the original content business, too<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s potentially 7 different monthly bills where just 10 years ago you&rsquo;d pay one company and be done with it. Forget the days when all your TV would just work, today there&rsquo;s a question if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the world&rsquo;s biggest content producer&rsquo;s new service will work on the world&rsquo;s biggest tech company&rsquo;s streaming device<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->content<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is better than it was then, without a doubt, and the ability to watch whenever (I&rsquo;m old enough to have programmed a VCR in my life) but the experience as a consumer is worse.</p>

			 <p>In 2008, when my parents sold the house I grew up in and started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cruising the world in an RV<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, they gave me their flatscreen television for safe keeping. The expectation was that they&rsquo;d do the On The Road thing for a couple of years and then take it back when they settled down. They&rsquo;re still doing it, and the TV is now hilariously out of date. And a couple of weeks ago, the antenna connection stopped working, meaning it was time to upgrade.</p>
<p>The main requirements were: about 40 inches, wide viewing angle, at least 3 HDMI inputs, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never ever ever a Samsung<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I was hoping I could also purchase it from a local brick-and-mortar store (instead of online) for an insignificant premium. We don&rsquo;t need a 4k screen (at that size, and with our couch 11ft away from the screen, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it wasn&rsquo;t necessary<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I spent lots of time reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wirecutter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rtings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4k.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The Wirecutter recommended TV (Vizio M43-C1) was very very close to what I needed, but it didn&rsquo;t have a great viewing angle. I ended up deciding on a 43-inch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sony X830C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Great viewing angle and plenty of HDMI. Rtings felt the contrast wasn&rsquo;t great and the surface was too reflective, but 4k.com didn&rsquo;t really agree and general picture quality wasn&rsquo;t super high on our list &ndash; I was sure it would be better than our old free screen.</p>
<p>Anyhow, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it&rsquo;s on the wall now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Six inches larger than the old screen, but covers up less wall. Definitely good. More detailed thoughts coming after I get more time to watch it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->UPDATE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: After using the TV for the past two months, I&rsquo;m definitely a fan. The reflectivity is not a problem, and the colors and viewing angle are excellent. We almost never use our Roku box anymore, which isn&rsquo;t its fault, it&rsquo;s just that our TV does everything we used it for. Android TV is pretty good, I think our TV has only crash-rebooted a couple of times (which is a weird concept). The UI could be a bit faster, but whatever. It&rsquo;s nice having the Guide be accurate even though we only use an antenna (however our old TV used to get its guide had stopped working years ago). The biggest complaint I have is that the remote is sort of a disaster.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a running joke that Bill Belichick likes to trade out of the first round of the NFL Draft, acquiring a larger number of late-round picks. This joke depends on his identity as something of a passionless rogue thinker. So after he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->used<!-- raw HTML omitted --> his first round draft pick last night to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->draft an actual football player<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I decided to look back at his history as Head Coach (and de facto General Manager) of the New England Patriots. Here&rsquo;s the full list of what he did with first round picks:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So in the past fifteen drafts, he&rsquo;s drafted 13 players in the first round (including 2 after trading downward within the round and 4 after trading upward) and got out of the first round entirely 5 times. Draw whatever conclusion you like, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a particularly strong trend to me. From 2007-2011, however, he traded down or out with 5 of their 6 picks &ndash; I wonder if that&rsquo;s where this reputation originated.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the bouncing screensaver. And we&rsquo;ve all watched, hoping it would fall into the corner. Oh, you haven&rsquo;t? Well, watch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this documentary footage<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the adventure you&rsquo;ve been missing.</p>
<p>The screensaver isn&rsquo;t mysterious. It moves in predictable ways, meaning we can calculate how often it&rsquo;ll hit the corner (and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it will hit a corner). So let&rsquo;s start with some assumptions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From this, we can make a few quick observations. The total distance it has traveled left and right is always equal to the total distance it has traveled up and down. And in order to land in a corner, it must have traveled a whole multiple of the both the width and the height of the screen. Or to put it mathematically:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We can find the lowest possible values for both <!-- raw HTML omitted -->m<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which must be integers) fairly easily. The definition of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->greatest common divisor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of W and H implies that:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>You can follow the same logic to calculate the value of m.</p>
<p>So now we know how many times the bouncing object travels the width of the screen (m) and the height of the screen (n). Each of those traversals will be followed by a bounce. We&rsquo;ll need to subtract 1, because the last bounce &ndash; the impossible dream, the bounce in the corner &ndash; is counted as a horizontal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a vertical bounce. So the number of bounces necessary is:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out how many times Jim and Pam and the others would have to watch the screen saver bounce to see it go into a corner. The DVD was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->most likely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> running at an effective resolution of 640x480 (equivalent to 480p). It&rsquo;s hard to tell the size of the bouncing object, but it&rsquo;s definitely smaller than a quarter of the height, plus it appears to have an non-bouncing border. Let&rsquo;s eyeball it at 50x50. So:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Left as an exercise for the reader: Which corner will the object bounce in? Is it possible for the object to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bounce in the upper-left hand corner (where it starts)?</p>

<p>But because I live in the Red Sox&rsquo;s &ldquo;home television territory&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m unable to watch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any of their games<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, both at home and away, without resorting to using proxies. Paying nearly a hundred dollars a year for the right to not get to watch any of the games I care about is very stupid. These are based on ancient cable contracts, I&rsquo;m certain, but MLB has the upper hand in these negotiations. Are the networks really going to say &ldquo;nevermind, we won&rsquo;t show your games&rdquo; if MLB insists on allowing paying customers to watch even local games online?</p>
<p>Until Major League Baseball joins us in the 21st century with their blackout restrictions, I&rsquo;m not going to be paying for MLB.TV anymore. I&rsquo;ll just have to enjoy the game at a bar, where Major League Baseball will get none of my dollars.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I&rsquo;m trying to get back into the swing of building and optimizing and evaluating algorithms, my first step is always to write a whole bunch of sorting implementations.

(The insertion and heap sort implementations are both in-place. The other two are not.)</p>
<p>The second step is probably going to be to implement a data structure I&rsquo;ve never done before. Last time, it was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a min-max heap in PHP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;m thinking maybe a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->B-tree<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>

			 <p>When Matt Cain <!-- raw HTML omitted -->threw a Perfect Game<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the San Francisco Giants on Thursday, he became the fifth pitcher in the last four years to do so (no, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Galarraga&rsquo;s game<!-- raw HTML omitted --> doesn&rsquo;t count). Perfect Games are also No-Hitters, and there have been a startling 22 no-hitters in the past six seasons (here I am including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Halladay&rsquo;s post-season no-hitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> two years ago).</p>
<p>Since the end of the Steroid Era in baseball, pitching has been under a resurgence. Last year was called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Year Of The Strikeout<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by some, and this year is, so far, exceeding last year&rsquo;s number. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In addition<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, runs per game and hits per inning have been in decline for the past decade, too. But this isn&rsquo;t just because batters aren&rsquo;t hitting as hard or fielding has improved. Walks per inning, too, are at their lowest point in 20 years.</p>
<p>Improved pitching means a better chance of No-Hitters and Perfect Games. Does that explain it completely? Is the recent surge in pitching gems a coincidence &ndash; in which case we can expect the frequency to revert to the mean &ndash; or a result of improving pitching? I started collecting data to answer this question myself (which you can see after the break), but during the course of my research I found an article by Rebecca Sichel, Uri Carl and Bruce Bukiet titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Modeling Perfect Games and No-Hitters in Baseball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>Planetary orbits are not perfectly circular; in fact, they are ellipses. An ellipse is a mathematical shape approximately equivalent to what is typically called an oval. An ellipse, though, meets some very specific criteria. One is that, unlike a circle, it has two foci instead of a single center. Where a circle is defined as the set of points whose distance to the center are some constant distance (the radius), an ellipse is the set of points whose distances to the two foci add to a constant. This allows you to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->construct an ellipse<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with some pins, some string, and a pencil.</p>
<p>So what are the two foci of planetary orbits? Well, one is the Sun. The other one? Just some random spot in space. And because each planet has a different size orbit with a different eccentricity (a measurement of how non-circular the orbit is), each planet has a non-Sun focus in a different place. Here is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google doc spreadsheet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with information on each planet&rsquo;s orbit. A visualization after the jump.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Venus and Earth have very round orbits. Mercury&rsquo;s is surprisingly un-round &ndash; nearly as eccentric as (although much smaller than) Pluto&rsquo;s.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this year, Citizen&rsquo;s Bank Park (the home of the Philadelphia Phillies) began selling several different brands of beer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in 24-ounce tallboy cans<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Canned beer (like boxed wine) has been on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->resurgence in recent years<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, thanks to improvements in technology and some open-minded brewers. Harpoon Brewery started canning <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some summer beers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a couple of years ago, but now they are spending more than a million dollars to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->add canning machinery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to their main brewery in Boston.</p>
<p>Canned beer at a ballpark, however, is a good idea in almost every single sense I can think of:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And there&rsquo;s just something about drinking a cold beer out of a can that says &ldquo;summer&rdquo; more than a bottle or a cup.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what beer is available where in the park<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Most everywhere has cans of Stella Artois and Yuengling, two very good lagers. I&rsquo;m not sure if the Oskar Blues and Sierra Nevada brands are in the tallboys or if they&rsquo;re only available in normal 12-ounce cans. I will investigate when I&rsquo;m at the game against the Red Sox this coming Saturday, and report back.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update, 21 May:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The 24-ounce cans are pretty much only available in Yuengling Lager, and we only found them on the lower level. Most of the other types of beer are in more-typical 16-ounce cans (500mL in the case of Stella Artois). Still: great selection, decent price, all the above points about convenience still stand.</p>

			 <p>Say you had code that generated random keys. These random keys were 6 letters long, all caps, with no duplicates. Here&rsquo;s a few, as an example:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What are the chances that the key that you generate will be in alphabetical order? For instance, above, there&rsquo;s only one in alphabetical order (CERSUY, in bold) And then, if you think you have that, generalize: For any string of length <!-- raw HTML omitted -->k<!-- raw HTML omitted --> distinct characters chosen from a set of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, what are the chances that they will be in order? My answer after the break.</p>
<p>I spent several minutes trying to solve this the straightforward way. You only have 21 choices for the first letter, because if it&rsquo;s anything after U, there&rsquo;s no way to have five more letters that come after it. Then for the second letter, you have 22-<!-- raw HTML omitted -->a<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the index of the first letter) choices. For instance, if the first letter was E, you have only 22-5, or 17 choices &ndash; namely anything between F and V. After going through all six letters, you end up with this ungainly thing:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s probably possible to simplify that somewhat by looking at reductive cases &ndash; you can model a two-letter key as a grid of allowed possibilities, but even that would get pretty challenging pretty quickly. If you look at it from another direction, however, things get much easier. Consider a single key, let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;NTCYAR&rdquo; (the first in the table above). How many possible permutations of that key are there? Simple: 6<em>5</em>4<em>3</em>2*1, or 6!. Of those, how many of them are in alphabetical order? Even simpler: 1 (ACNRTY). In fact, this is true for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any set<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of six letters you choose &ndash; you could have picked those same letters in any of 6! possible orderings, and only one is in alphabetical order. So there you go. Your answer is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The interesting thing? The probability doesn&rsquo;t depend on the length of your alphabet, only on the length of the key. The generalized probability is simply:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last April, to no one in particular, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->asked the following question<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It became clear, after a brief discussion with some friends, that the shortest possible trip is somewhere on the order of a hundred miles. Citi Field in the Bronx and Yankee Stadium in Queens are only 6 miles apart. Since the Mets and the Yankees are in different leagues and each team <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plays one series at home<!-- raw HTML omitted --> against every other team in its own league, you could just spend the whole season going back and forth between the two stadiums. (In fact, I&rsquo;d be surprised if at least one New Yorker baseball fan with time and money to burn hadn&rsquo;t done exactly this.)</p>
<p>In order to avoid this &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; solution, a modification to the puzzle would have to be introduced. After throwing around a bunch of attempts, I hit upon the perfect goal: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15 games, 15 stadiums, 30 teams<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You&rsquo;d see no team play more than once, you&rsquo;d be in no stadium more than once.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Now that I had a problem worth solving, how to solve it? The sheer number of games makes it pretty clear that this is a task that can&rsquo;t be solved by brute force. There are 2430 games in a regular season of baseball. The possible number of any selection of 15 of those games is 4.45 × 10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->38<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Even if I could check a trillion schedules a second (which I can&rsquo;t), it would still take 14 billion billion years (at which point, even the Red Sox would probably have a new stadium). If you visualized the problem as a graph, each game would be a node and each travel day would be an edge. The problem was that every game had an edge that led to every game that came after it. What I needed to do first was prune this tree.</p>
<p>So I made some assumptions for the sake of making a reasonable road trip. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wouldn&rsquo;t want more than 2 days off between games, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to travel more than 500 miles on any given day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This change trimmed the 3-million-plus edges into a mere 86,000. But an exhaustive search would still take a prohibitively long time: at that same impossible speed, I&rsquo;d have my answer in merely 11 billion years. I made the problem more than a billion times smaller, but realistically I wasn&rsquo;t any closer to the solution.</p>
<p>It was about this time that I decided I was never going to get the perfect answer. I would have to resign myself to a Good Enough plan that could be calculated before the heat death of the universe (or better yet, before Opening Day). I brushed up on my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Traveling Salesman Problem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and pathfinding algorithms like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A*<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dijkstra&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Floyd-Warshall<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But my problem had a couple of quirks that made those approaches unsuitable:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> After three or four false starts (and one moment where a bug in my data structure made an exhaustive search running a couple quadrillion times faster than it should), I happened upon a promising technique. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A commenter on Stack Overflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recommended (in response to a purposely vague question) doing a sort of prioritized breadth-first search. What I ended up doing was starting with a list of all of the one-game plans (2430 plan, one for each game). And then I did this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And I repeated until the &ldquo;shortest plan&rdquo; was 15 games long. On the first try, it took about 3 and a half hours on my laptop (Core i5 with 4GB of RAM) and had to inspect more than 12.5 million potential plans before finding one that was a full 15 games long. The solution was almost 5,500 miles long, and included back to back 800-mile legs from Los Angeles to Denver and then to St. Louis. That did not strike me as optimal. I considered what could be preventing the discovery of a good plan: the problem is that the shortest eight-game plan might not yield any short nine-game plans, and if the list is full and discards the longer eight-game plans before they can even be checked, then it will never pursue the most promising leads. In truth, I run four lists in parallel, and they fit 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->19<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-1 elements each (a little over 500k). But the lists are full after only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->three minutes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of inspecting plans (less than half a million). These lists take up more than 2GB of memory right now.</p>
<p>I chose to try the script on an Extra Large Amazon <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elastic Compute Cloud<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instance. This includes not quite as much CPU power as my laptop, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->four times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the memory. I also changed the way the algorithm treated &ldquo;the shortest average leg length&rdquo;, by giving plans with more legs a bonus. It found this schedule in less than ten minutes, and failed to find a better one even after searching through 20+ million more. (This is a thousand miles shorter than the one I found earlier, and the only really long leg is from Boston to Minneapolis.)</p>

<p>Remember, this isn&rsquo;t the best you could do, but it&rsquo;s probably close, and it was computable in a very reasonable amount of time. Interestingly, the shortest 13-game road trip is about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->half as long<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (about 2400 miles, with no leg longer than 350). Picking up those last couple of games is quite expensive. It&rsquo;s been suggested that seeing a team more than once for the sake of saving several hundred miles might be acceptable &ndash; but establishing an algorithmic rule might take some time. Stay tuned for further tweaks!</p>

			 <p>Imagine two hypothetical pitchers. Their ERAs are very close together and both pretty average: 3.40 and 3.41. They&rsquo;ve both pitched just over 200 innings in 30 starts with just a couple weeks of the season remaining. But one pitcher has had some pretty advantageous matchups: he&rsquo;s played the Padres four times, the Reds and Rockies twice each, the Pirates, the Mets, the Royals &ndash; all teams with records under .500. The other pitcher, on the other hand, has had a harder schedule: four games each against the Yankees and the Red Sox, two against the Rangers, and one in Detroit. Are these equivalent pitchers?</p>
<p>I set out to determine if pitchers we accept as &ldquo;elite&rdquo; are truly that great, or if some might have an unfair advantage due to schedules. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I downloaded all of MLB&rsquo;s gamelogs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the 2011 regular season up through yesterday, and then I parsed them, tracking a few key pieces of information. First, the number of innings each pitcher pitched against each team. Second, the average number of earned runs each team scores per inning. Then, for each pitcher, I calculated what their ERA would be if they allowed exactly their opponent&rsquo;s average for each appearance. Here are the results (for pitchers who have enough innings pitched to qualify for the ERA title):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One interesting takeaway is that there aren&rsquo;t any huge surprises. Of the pitchers with the ten best actual ERAs, only one of them (Cole Hamels) isn&rsquo;t in the top ten for the best differential. Another interesting fact is how much a pitcher&rsquo;s expected ERA is affected by simple rotation timing, and not just the team&rsquo;s schedule. The Phillies have played against a lot of sub-.500 teams this year, and Cole Hamels has one of the lowest expected ERAs. But his teammate Cliff Lee hasn&rsquo;t been so lucky &ndash; his expected ERA is higher than most.</p>
<p>But there are some people who get a nudge from good to great with this analysis. Oh, and those two hypothetical pitchers I mentioned? They aren&rsquo;t hypothetical. They&rsquo;re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daniel Hudson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Diamondbacks and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Price<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Rays, respectively. This puts a little context on the fact that Price&rsquo;s record is 12-12 and Hudson&rsquo;s is 16-9.</p>

			 <p>I just started the wheels moving for a FedEx Day at work. Here&rsquo;s what we wrote up for it:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>People don&rsquo;t stay at Texterity because of the money. We pay our developers competitively, but not lucratively (nor should we). People stay here because they like the stuff we&rsquo;re working on and the people they&rsquo;re working with. We haven&rsquo;t lost a lot of developers, but when we do, the very competitive job market makes it a challenge to fill those positions. Jason A, Vijay, Arun, Dasheng; each of those losses has been painful in its own way. The best way that we can encourage tech workers to stay is to make them feel needed and give them purpose. The most exciting projects I&rsquo;ve ever worked on were the ones where I had pretty much complete autonomy and was passionate about the end result. It&rsquo;ll give all of the team members a chance to try something new and challenging and maybe even give us some outside-of-the-box features and products.</p>
<p>A FedEx Day would have some other benefits, too. For a day, the developers would be decision makers where they typically are not. They&rsquo;d be able to see what it looks like from the product owner&rsquo;s point of view. What&rsquo;s a valuable feature? What&rsquo;s worth spending time and testing on? How do you sell its value to management when you demo it? And there&rsquo;s a good chance we&rsquo;d end up with some features or products that we wouldn&rsquo;t have come up with otherwise &ndash; Atlassian says they end up shipping about half of the FedEx Day projects.</p>
<p>We have plans for making sure that emergencies get handled and we have ideas for scheduling so that day-to-day operations are impacted as little as possible, but those discussions can come later.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to hear more about motivation and purpose in preparation for the meeting, I suggest watching this fantastic ten minute presentation by Dan Pink:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>

			 <p>Inspired by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Eternal Shame of Your First Online Handle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, here&rsquo;s my story. My first online handle was simply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pink Floyd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I was somewhat obsessed with them when I connected (via 2400 modem) to C-C-Chat, a ten-user simultaneous chat system. This was probably 1994. Within not too long, I was going by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pinky<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more than the full version. I bounced back and forth between Pinky and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zamboni Man<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on local BBSes.</p>
<p>When I logged into IRC for the first time in 1996 or so, &ldquo;Pinky&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pink Floyd&rdquo; and many derivatives thereof were taken on the quite busy EfNet. So to come up with a unique name, I just concatenated the first two things I came up with. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CheesePez<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was born. I finally stumbled upon Plutor in a fit of sleep deprivation the summer between High School and college. I think nowadays the most promising online handles aren&rsquo;t words or names, but rather simply pronounceable strings of letters.</p>

			 <p>I have more than 40GB of music I&rsquo;ve ripped from my own CDs, purchased from a variety of locations (eMusic, Amazon, iTunes, some musicians' own websites) and in a few cases, yes, pirated. I listen to music at work, at home, in my car, and while running, and it&rsquo;d be really nice to be able to take advantages of these new recently-announced cloud services (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) to store and access my music from anywhere. But no company is forever. IBM and HP are shells of once-invulnerable corporations. Microsoft no longer innovates &ndash; they follow. None of these companies (as large as they are right now) will necessarily be around in twenty years, and there&rsquo;s no guarantee that any of their services will be around in even five.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a limited connection, which means uploading music to Amazon or Google would take something like a week. And my Android phone and Linux work computer will almost certainly not cooperate with Apple. So what&rsquo;s a guy to do? For now, I plan on continuing to do things the old fashioned way. I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of cloud service would make me feel comfortable spending the time uploading all of my music, but so far, it&rsquo;s not any of these.</p>

			 <p>While looking for a little preview on tonight&rsquo;s Red Sox - Angels game (which I&rsquo;ll be heading to), I happened upon these blog posts about Why We Watch baseball and a neat statistic to help find the great matchups. I read them in reverse, but here they are in chronological order:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s pitchers are Clay Buchholz (with bad year so far and a NERD of 0) and Jared Weaver (7), both of whom were scheduled to start Sunday but were pushed back a day for (unrelated?) illnesses. Both teams have a NERD of 4, which gives the game a NERD of 4. I&rsquo;m hoping that Clay pitches like he did last year, and it could turn out to be more exciting game than the stat predicts.</p>

			 <p>This year will be the fourth season that I&rsquo;ve played Fantasy Baseball. I&rsquo;m a baseball fan, and I have a pretty good knowledge of the most prominent players of the game. But it&rsquo;s far from encyclopedic. I have at least a couple of co-workers who can walk into draft night with no real preparation at all, and end up schooling me. What I do have, though, is an analytic mind and a desire for rigor (albeit half-assed rigor). The last couple of years, I&rsquo;ve been pulling down players stats from the season before, doing a little magic, and coming up with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some sort of an order<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But I&rsquo;ve finished in sixth place and then in seventh (out of 12).</p>
<p>There are some complexities in fantasy baseball that make an accurate analysis difficult. As a manager, you need to draft at least one player at each position, a couple general &ldquo;hitters&rdquo;, a couple starting pitchers, and a couple relief pitchers (the exact numbers vary from league to league). But there are some positions (catcher and second base in particular) that have very concentrated hitting skills. There are probably three catchers who could be considered &ldquo;great&rdquo; hitters. Does the scarcity increase the value of those catchers? How much?</p>
<p>Not all of the stats that are tracked by fantasy leagues can be considered equal. Compare, for instance, RBI and stolen bases. Just about any player that gets drafted will have a minimum of 40 RBIs, but only about half a dozen players will finish with that many stolen bases and at least half will probably have less than 10. So any specific stolen base is more likely to make the difference, since teams' numbers in that stat are more likely to be low. Is a base-stealing average-hitter worth more than a slow heavy-hitter? How much?</p>
<p>And every time it&rsquo;s your turn to draft a player, you can choose any available player at any position. If you take one of the great catchers early, you might not get a premiere starting pitcher. How can you be sure the tradeoff you made was wise? Hitters and pitchers are scored on completely different criteria, making comparing them even harder.</p>
<p>So how can we possibly take this kind of system and predict how much a player is worth? At the end of the day, what you want in a head-to-head league is &ldquo;wins&rdquo;, so the most useful end statistic would be one that you can use to determine &ldquo;If I drafted Player A instead of Player B, I&rsquo;d end up with (on average) this many more wins&rdquo;. After spending some abortive attempts trying to come up with an algorithm, I realized it didn&rsquo;t have to be that hard. I could throw computing power at it and run a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monte Carlo simulation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did. I started with someone else&rsquo;s player-by-player predictions for 2011 stats (the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marcel the Monkey Forecasting System<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, specifically). Then I wrote a script that would simulate a ten-team league over and over. I had to simplify the rules a little bit &ndash; figuring out what to do about benching players and trades and pitcher off-days was just too much. After each simulated season, I determined how many wins over exactly average each team was, and I credited every player on that team with that many wins. Over time, good players would more likely to be on good teams than bad ones, and their averages would be high. Less-good players' averages would be low.</p>
<p>After <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two million<!-- raw HTML omitted --> one million (see update below) seasons, I had some pretty firm numbers, and some surprising results.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Keep in mind the caveats: This was a ten-team five-by-five head-to-head league. The WOA column (&ldquo;Wins Over Average&rdquo;) is the most useful number, and it&rsquo;s what the spreadsheet is sorted by. It&rsquo;s scaled for a nine-week season (each team played each other team once), which obviously is not standard, but it&rsquo;s directly proportional to a real 24-week season.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Multiply by 2.66, and you see that drafting Albert Pujols is worth almost 26 wins over the average player and 2.44 wins over the second-most-valuable player, Hanley Ramirez. After those first two infielders, there&rsquo;s a lot of pitchers, which goes counter to a lot of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->common advice out there<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Which I like. Joe Mauer is the first catcher, at 27th (third round in a ten-team league).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the code and source files that I used<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, if you&rsquo;re interested in giving it some tweaks of your own. I used the standard 5x5 stats, but you can change those pretty easily. It took about 90 minutes to run a million seasons on my not-state-of-the-art computer.</p>

			 <p>Since April 19, the Yankees are 71-47, Rays are 72-47, and the Red Sox are 70-48.  It&rsquo;s not that the Sox have been bad.  In fact, in 2009 between games 13 and 131 they were 70-48, and in 2008 they were 69-49.  They have been just as good as in previous years.  The problem is that the team fell to a quick deficit and has been trying to catch two other extremely good teams.  There&rsquo;s a good chance the AL East will finish the year with two teams with 100+ wins, and Boston with 90+ wins.  I&rsquo;m almost certain this hasn&rsquo;t happened as long as there have been divisions (1969). The closest I can find is 1977, when the top three teams in the AL East finished with 100, 97, and 97 wins respectively.  But remember, that was a six-team division, not four.</p>
<p>To look at this season and draw the conclusion that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we&rsquo;ve had<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a bad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->year<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is to ignore the actual facts.  We just haven&rsquo;t had as good of a year as we needed to have in order to make up our losses in the first couple of weeks.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve now played StarCraft 2 for two days.  I&rsquo;ve finished five missions on the single-player campaign, and played a handful of co-op multiplayer games.  If you had asked me to describe the game based on the Beta, I would have said it was just StarCraft HD.  Higher resolution, more beautiful, some new tech, but the gameplay is identical.  The single player campaign, though, is where this game really shines.  The original StarCraft&rsquo;s single player was essentially a series of levels that got steadily harder and had some story connecting them.  The sequel turns makes the stages non-linear, introduces credits as reward for some stages that you can then use to hire mercenary units when you&rsquo;re in a bind for near-instant help or spend on research to improve units, and secondary objectives in some missions allow you to earn alien research points you can use to improve buildings.  The original game only had ten Terran missions, and I&rsquo;m willing to bet there are triple that in this game.  Plus there are probably seven hundred achievements.</p>
<p>The multiplayer is fun, but you kinda need to be a semi-professional to do well at it.  As Splatta said the other day, that seems too much like work.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wrote about the failings of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Diamond Age<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a message to my brother a week ago.  Now that I have actually finished the book, I can say that my problems with it are still valid.  First, the good: I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone better than Neal Stephenson when it comes to creating a believable universe around a technologically advanced future.  In both this and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Snow Crash<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, his world is fully realized and&ndash;more importantly&ndash;socially complex.</p>
<p>But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Diamond Age<!-- raw HTML omitted --> clearly is affected by Stephenson&rsquo;s ongoing scatterbraineditis in a way that Snow Crash was able to avoid.  It&rsquo;s actually a pretty clear progression from the great plot of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zodiac<!-- raw HTML omitted --> through to the spaghetti nonsense of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cryponomicon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He creates this nanotech-infused world, introduces us to a few characters and gets us to love them and root for them.  Hackworth vanishes from the storyline, then Miranda, then Nell seems to be the central character.  Then she disappears when Hackworth reappears and now we&rsquo;re supposed to care about Fiona for a chapter or two.  Then Carl Hollywood becomes a central character.  And what ever happened to Dr. X?  What&rsquo;s up with the Fists?  Oh, here comes the Mouse Army seemingly from nowhere (or more accurately 200 pages ago).  The conflict that supposedly gets resolved doesn&rsquo;t even begin to appear until three-quarters of the way through the book.  And now that I think about it, I&rsquo;m not sure what the conflict was or even if it was resolved.</p>
<p>I really wanted to love this one, especially since I liked the world so much more than the virtual reality world of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Snow Crash<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  But at least in that book, there was more or less a single conflict, clear protagonists (one was even helpfully <!-- raw HTML omitted -->named<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Protagonist).  When Stephenson writes sprawling epics, he forgets to put in a direction for the story to go.</p>

			 <p>As everyone who cares already knows, the health care reform bill passed the House late last night.  From a policy point of view, it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a really great thing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The individual insurance mandate combined with the ban of dropping insurees or excluding care for &ldquo;pre-existing conditions&rdquo; will be big.  In fact, the individual changes that the reform puts in place are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->widely supported<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of mitigating circumstances that are keeping me from celebrating today.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->accounting hand-wave tricks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are in the bill to make it look like a budgetary winner are disgusting.  The complete inability for the Democrats to get any moderate Republicans on board with what is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> centrist bill (not to mention the couple dozen moderate Democrats that voted against it) is a real shame.  And as a pro-choice liberal, I can&rsquo;t help but feel disappointed that anti-choice conservatives <!-- raw HTML omitted -->get to keep any of us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from helping poor women get abortions, but I couldn&rsquo;t keep my money from being used to invade Iraq.</p>
<p>In the end, I simply hope the administration learned <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a couple of important lessons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Most importantly, if Obama wants something to happen, he needs to be more engaged from day one.  I also hope that this reform&rsquo;s passage helps conservatives realize that the Tea Party&rsquo;s scorched earth methods <!-- raw HTML omitted -->aren&rsquo;t going to work for them<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and compromise really is a better idea.</p>

			 <p>Looking back, 2009 was great year for my reading list.  Although I only read three fiction books (not counting the collection of Science Fiction I used as waiting-for-inter-library-loan filler), they were all remarkably good.  Next year&rsquo;s list is likely to be very interesting.  Not only am I trying to figure out how to fit my new Kindle (thanks, Mom and Dad!) into my reading habits, but I also hope to get fiction recommendations from other people for 2010 so I can try to divide my time 50/50.  Right now there are four books on my nightstand, and they&rsquo;re all non-fiction.  What a bad start to that New Year&rsquo;s resolution.</p>

			 <p>What I asked for for birthday/Hannukah/Christmas: Freedom from shoe shopping. I hate that all the shoes kinda look the same to me.  And I feel like I&rsquo;m inconveniencing the salesperson every time I want to try on a different style. (Plus my feet are wide, so it&rsquo;s hard to get the best fit the first size I try.) And you only get like three minutes to decide on a pair of shoes. What I wanted was for someone to go to the store, pick out five or six styles of shoes, buy them in 10½, and bring them to me.  I could wear them at home over a weekend, pick out the ones I like the most, and then the giver would bring the others back.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of karma-accumulation websites.  You know what kind of site I mean: Other people can vote up or down your stories and comments, and you get points when you&rsquo;re voted up, and lose points when you&rsquo;re voted down.  There are lots of these, each with their own scoring foibles: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Digg<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reddit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are two of the most well-known.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slashdot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has done it for a while (in fact, I think they&rsquo;re why I still call this concept &ldquo;karma&rdquo;).  The concept is good: You limit the requirements for moderators by allowing users to essentially moderate each other.  If a post or comment gets enough down votes, it might vanish.  If a post gets a lot of up votes, it becomes more prominent.  Fewer dedicated moderators generally means lower overhead costs and, in theory, a &ldquo;fairer&rdquo; moderation policy.</p>
<p>In practice, though, there are a lot of things to not like about these schemes.  Accumulating points becomes an end in itself, which leads to posting a lot of simple or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->purposely-misrepresented posts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (&ldquo;whoring&rdquo;). When points are used to control if your posts are seen at all, creating multiple sockpuppet accounts to vote up your own contributions (&ldquo;gaming&rdquo;) is inevitable. On the larger sites, an above-the-fold link can mean tens of thousands of hits; gaming then becomes a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lucrative business<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Preventing whoring and gaming through algorithms can work, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->search engine optimizers are smart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and tenacious.  It&rsquo;s a continuous arms-race.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stack Overflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a point (&ldquo;reputation&rdquo;) accumulating site that somehow works extremely well.  At first glance, it is a simple programming question-and-answer forum where you gain reputation for answering questions and having those answers voted up or chosen as &ldquo;correct&rdquo; by the asker.  But there&rsquo;s a number of things I haven&rsquo;t seen anywhere else that makes Stack Overflow excel where other sites struggle.  The most obvious difference is that you are able to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do more things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as you gain reputation.  You can&rsquo;t even vote up questions or answers until you&rsquo;ve received a couple of votes of your own, increasing the burden to entry for sockpuppets and gaming.  Maybe more importantly, points accumulation isn&rsquo;t single dimensional.  Stack Overflow gives you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->badges<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for activities that are difficult to game, and displays your badge count right next to your reputation.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a bigger reason why this works on Stack Overflow.  There&rsquo;s no real benefit to gaming or whoring.  Since the focus of the website is question-and-answer, instead of directing traffic to other websites, there&rsquo;s almost no way to make a profit from having a question voted way up.  And the relative smallness of the audience compared to some of the giants out there means that even if there was a way to turn a profit, focusing on other sites would still give you a better return.  What&rsquo;s left to be seen is if Stack Overflow can keep such a high signal-to-noise ratio as it continues to grow.</p>

			 <p>Just over a year ago, I was sitting in a classroom at Sun&rsquo;s virtually deserted Burlington campus, learning a new programming language from a living human in person for possibly the first time in my whole life.  The class itself was a little slow; it definitely wasn&rsquo;t geared towards experienced developers.  But it was more effective learning than fiddling at work had been, since it successfully prevented all distractions.  Now that I&rsquo;ve had a year to work with the language (and have gone back and forth to programming in Perl), there&rsquo;s several reasons why I&rsquo;m still using Java.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I could probably come up with a dozen other reasons that I enjoy programming in Java, but those are the big ones that make my life easy.</p>

			 <p>After doing yet more research on benchmarks and prices, I&rsquo;ve backed away from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->revolutionary stance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Intel processors.  The Athlon 64 X2 represents a fair approximation, and the CPU and motherboard combo I&rsquo;ve chosen will save me about $150 off of the Intel alternative.  Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m ordering tonight:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Motherboard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GIGABYTE GA-MA780G-UD3H<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (780G chipset, ATI Radeon HD 3200 on-board, although I won&rsquo;t be using it)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->CPU<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Dual 2.9GHz cores, 2x512K L2, 65W)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Video card<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radeon HD 4870 1GB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (My first PCIe x16 card!  Note that this is actually a bump over the previous plan)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Memory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->G.SKILL 4GB DDR2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (1066 MHz, dual-channel, CAS 5. A tiny upgrade in speed)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hard drive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Western Digital Caviar WD6400AAKS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (640GB, 7200 RPM, this hasn&rsquo;t changed)</p>
<p>Add in an HDMI cable (my screen and current video card support it, but for some reason I never got around to buying one) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one of the best reviewed AM2 heatsinks on the market<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it all adds up to just over $550 including shipping.  Even cheaper than I was expecting.</p>
<p>The savings will probably go towards an HTPC build from the old hardware.  Details to come!  Maybe!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the most interesting things I learned while looking up these events is how close together the Challenger disaster and the Halley&rsquo;s Comet perihelion were.  In fact, the Shuttle mission (STS-51-L) and the following scheduled mission (STS-61-E) had apparently been scheduled to observe the comet up close.  In my mind, those two events were far apart.  Along the same lines, the Mets won the World Series just a couple of months after my family moved to Connecticut, but somehow I suddenly became a Mets fan.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got my new desktop birthday gift essentially planned at this point.  I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of reading on Tom&rsquo;s Hardware and Ars Technica, and both of them are pointing at Intel for solid mid-range desktops nowadays.  There&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->disagreement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over whether the Core i7 (Quad-core on one die! Triple-channel DDR3!) is worth the price premium over the Core 2 Duo. I&rsquo;ve decided that, for me, it&rsquo;s not. I don&rsquo;t do enough video gaming anymore for four cores to be effectively utilized.  Even two cores feels like a bit of a waste.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still deciding on a case (although I really like everything Lian Li, like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PC-7B plus II<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) since the case is a part that I feel that M should have a say in.  But the guts are going to be as follows:</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been several years since microATX motherboards became commonplace, kicking the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Home Theater PC movement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into high gear.  While researching hardware to build a new desktop computer, I ran into an interesting question: Can it be an HTPC?  The &ldquo;HT&rdquo; part of the quotient would require it to be able to connect to my television, which is currently in a different room than my desktop, and I want to be able to still sit down at the computer.  I don&rsquo;t want heavy VGA running from the machine down the hallway.  So it seems like I&rsquo;ve only got a couple of options:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Right now, option 3 sounds the most promising.  There are a handful of people who have talked about hooking high-end thin clients up to their TV to act as a home theater interface, but I&rsquo;ve found no discussion of doing it the other way, as far as I can tell.  I&rsquo;ll be investigating this deeper over the next few weeks.  But experimentation might be too expensive; I might just end up going for option 4.</p>

			 <p>Over Fourth of July weekend, I went up to Maine to M&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lakeside camp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  We went running one day, and stopped to pick wild raspberries on the side of the road.  When we were done, I noticed a large dog tick climbing up my leg.

<p>Several days later, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->found a deer tick<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in my hip.  It was removed by a licensed professional, and I didn&rsquo;t worry too much about it.

<p>The good news: early diagnosis equals a very good prognosis.  Three weeks of twice-daily antibiotics will almost certainly result in no long-term effects other than a boring medical story.</p>

He was hard working; he built the house that my dad and his brothers grew up in, and even made his own cinder blocks for the job. He was handy; he built a car engine from two diesel-powered refrigerators, harvested a transmission from a pickup truck, and made a custom two-seater <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maverick<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that, in his words, &ldquo;could pull a Mack truck up a brick wall at 60mph&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I can see a little of him in me, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he was everything I wish I was<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He was independent and sometimes stubborn; and he fell off his roof last week, while fixing his TV antenna.  At the age of 82.  I&rsquo;ll miss him.</p>

			 <p>I got a promotion yesterday.  Effective more or less immediately, I am the manager of one of two teams of developers.  I&rsquo;ll have two great developers reporting directly to me &ndash; one of whom is on vacation and is probably going to learn of this change while reading this very blog entry when he comes back next week.  Hi, Bryan! &ndash; and my very first task is to hire a third.  The first thing I learned about being a manager is that there are a hell of a lot more things to think about when you&rsquo;re the crux of a hiring decision than when you&rsquo;re just another interviewer voice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told a couple people about this already, and there have been two repeated questions: First, &ldquo;Are you still going to be able to do technical work?&rdquo;  Absolutely.  In fact, it was one of my requirements for accepting.  This is where I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go with my career &ndash; hence my dual BS in Computer Science and Management &ndash; but I never (ever) (EVER) want to stop coding or playing with new technology.  With such a small (and, I believe, low-maintenance) team, I expect to spend at least three-quarters of my time doing exactly what I did last week.</p>
<p>Second, &ldquo;Did you pursue this, or did your boss just offer it out of the blue?&rdquo;  I think it was a fortuitous combination.  The company is growing (we had 4 developers when I started here, we now have 8, plus 2 interns, and hope to add 3 more before the end of the calendar year), and the manager of the development team was having a harder and harder job keeping everything planned. At the same time, I&rsquo;m one of the most senior developers here, and I believe I&rsquo;ve had an unofficial leadership position here for a while.  I mentioned in my annual review last month that I was interested in more responsibility, and I think that just solidified thoughts my manager had already been having.</p>
<p>This transition will be easier than it could be, otherwise.  In fact, these are probably the ideal conditions.  There&rsquo;s no seniority clash.  There&rsquo;s not really anything Broken about the culture in the development group or at the company as a whole.  I sincerely enjoy the people I&rsquo;m working with, and I think they&rsquo;re all smart and hard working without being jerks or workaholics.  I don&rsquo;t feel the need to change a lot, organizationally, since it&rsquo;s all working very well.  I&rsquo;ll be able to ease into this new role with some hiring and planning (and soon, budgeting for fiscal &lsquo;09).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared, but excited.  It&rsquo;s like the clickety-clack part of the roller coaster ride.  You know what I mean.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update 6/5<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: The new group has a name, although it&rsquo;s possibly temporary: &ldquo;Publishing Technology&rdquo;.  We wanted to steer clear of words like &ldquo;internal&rdquo; (since we&rsquo;ll do publisher-facing apps), &ldquo;tools&rdquo; (which implies smaller utilities than what we work on), and &ldquo;workflow&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s just a small fraction of our purview). The other half of development is very simply the &ldquo;Products&rdquo; group.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Low-carbohydrate diets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> predate Robert Atkins' eponymous phenomenon by more than one hundred years.  The theory behind the diets goes like this: Food contains starches, which your body very quickly converts to glucose.  When glucose levels spike right after a meal, in order to prevent blood sugar levels from getting too high, you convert them into triglycerides for storage (usually in fat).  When your blood sugar gets very low, said fat stores (ideally) get <!-- raw HTML omitted -->converted to ketones<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which your body can use like glucose.  Low-carb diets work on the theory that the modern American diet never allows blood sugar to fall low enough for step 2 to occur.</p>
<p>On a whim, M and I are trying a one-week low-carb diet.  Lunch and dinner we can handle.  But what do you eat for breakfast when cereal and fruit and bagels are off limits?  I can only eat so many hard boiled eggs before I go nuts.</p>

			 <p>There have been 34 movies based on DC, Marvel, and Dark Horse comic books released in the past decade (9 by DC, 17 by Marvel, 8 by Dark Horse).  If you put any stock in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rotten Tomatoes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s raw percentage, the worst of them was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Son of the Mask<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (5%), and the best is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Iron Man<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (94% and currently in theaters).  2007 was an especially unremarkable year for comic book movies: only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spider-Man 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->300<!-- raw HTML omitted --> scored at least a 60%, and both just barely.  There are at least four more such films slated for release before the end of 2008, and based on my totally unbiased guesses, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dark Knight<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will be highly rated, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Incredible Hulk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hellboy II<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will be mediocre, and the sequel to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Punisher<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will be junk.</p>
<p>My brief unscientific survey showed that most people believe that Marvel would have the highest average rating.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daredevil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elektra<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s would be more than balanced out by the consistent high-quality of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->X-Men<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spiderman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> series.  In truth, DC edges out Marvel by a pedestrian 58 to 54%.  Dark Horse does worse, with a dismal 37%.</p>

			 <p>We could tell that the waitress serving the next table had a tattoo, but only about a quarter-inch of it extended beyond the bottom of her shirt sleeve.  What was visible wasn&rsquo;t complex.  It just looked like the bottom of a plain square.  &ldquo;I think that it&rsquo;s a Polaroid picture.&rdquo;  Maybe it was temporal proximity; just the day before, Brian had made me stuff his exposed Polaroids into my purse.  &ldquo;No way.  There is no way anyone would get that tattoo.  Not in a million years.&rdquo;  I thought it was a pretty good idea for a tattoo.  Simple, inoffensive to everyone, and you could even get strangers to draw in it with washable markers as an ice breaker.  &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;ll bet you one hundred dollars that it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why did I take the bet?  I&rsquo;m not sure.  Did I think he would pull his hand away at the last moment before shaking?  Is it because he offered me 10:1 odds?  Was I really sure that it was, indeed, a Polaroid photo?  No, it was definitely not that last one.</p>
<p>After Brian handed me my winnings, I told him what I was going to do with it: I was going to buy Polaroid film.  I still have no idea what I&rsquo;m going to use the ten packages of lightly-expired professional-quality 779 for, but buying something thematic makes me feel a little less like I&rsquo;m stealing from my friend.</p>

			 <p>A few years ago, my dad was laid off from IBM, where he&rsquo;d been working for more than 25 years.  Two weeks ago, he quit his job at a local small-business tech-support place.  Last week, my mom told IBM she was retiring at the end of February.  Their plan?  Finish the (until last week, somewhat languishing) work to their bedroom, sell the house and most of their belongings, buy an RV, and spend a year travelling the country.  When my dad says &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everyone thinks we&rsquo;re nuts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, he doesn&rsquo;t count me.

			 <p>For the past two years, I&rsquo;ve posted my reading list for the year as well as ratings and brief reviews for each book.  This year, I&rsquo;m going to do it a little different.  If you review my old lists (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2005<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2006 part 1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->part 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), you&rsquo;ll notice that it gets hard to describe unremarkable books from eleven months prior.  So instead I will share with you my thoughts about my three favorite books from 2007.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Book of the Year - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->World War Z<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Max Brooks<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I won&rsquo;t be surprised if you&rsquo;ve already been bored to tears with praise for this book.  Neither would I be shocked if you thought that a book about a fictional war with zombies wasn&rsquo;t going to be any more than a re-tread of decades-old plot elements.  But this book is something different than that.  Starting with the cover itself, Brooks creates a universe where the war actually happened.  The review quotes on the back and the biography on the flaps treat it as a documentary with historical implications.  It&rsquo;s written as a series of interviews with survivors: The doctor who met Patient Zero, soldiers who fought phalanxes of rampaging mobs in Yonkers, an isolate teenagers who had to escape from an apartment building in Japan by climbing down the outside of the building.  Each story is just a handful of pages long, but the interweaving storylines and Brooks' ability to give every character a unique personality make the book feel as true as he had intended.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Surprise of the Year - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Blind Side<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Michael Lewis<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Blind Side is a true story about a poor black boy from Memphis thrust into a wealthy white religious High School.  He&rsquo;s built like a linebacker, but he moves like a basketball player (and, in fact, plays for the basketball team for a while).  But when shifting football tactics make people built like him a precious commodity, his adopted family convinces him to play.  It&rsquo;s a great story, full of inspiration, and it showed me a glimpse into the world of football strategy other than &ldquo;get the ball down the field&rdquo;.  (Incidentally, I wish I remembered where I heard about this book.  It was on my list for more than a year before I stumbled on it in Logan Airport.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Classic of the Year - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I Am Legend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Richard Matheson<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inspired by the look and feel of the Will Smith movie, I decided to pick this up and read it.  It blew me away.  Matheson spends a long time showing you what years of loneliness and constant invasion can do to a person.  The setting and direction of the novel, as well as its moral, are very different from the movie, but the same intense feeling of a hero fighting an impossible struggle is obvious.  (Note that it&rsquo;s not a long story, maybe 150 pages, and the book I got had a number of Matheson&rsquo;s short stories along with it.  They were good, also, but none of them stuck out in my mind so much as the title story.)</p>

			 <p>At work, each new user is assigned a totally random alphanumeric 12-character ID.  They&rsquo;re random instead of sequential because this is what goes into the user&rsquo;s cookie (and in some cases into URLs) and we didn&rsquo;t want the IDs to be discoverable.  Sometimes we need to do what we call a subscriber load and generate thousands (or sometimes many thousands) of IDs at once.  The subload process tends to be very slow, and one of my co-workers was tasked with making it faster.  While profiling the code, he discovered that a big time sink was the ID generation procedure.  After more research, we discovered that it was written in 2004 and had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never<!-- raw HTML omitted --> been modified after the original checkin.  It was hundreds of lines long, used all kinds of global variables (Perl hasn&rsquo;t had static variables until 5.10), and involved big math with a magic prime number close to 70<!-- raw HTML omitted -->12<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Worse, it was implemented as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hash function<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And it was always passed a salt.  And that salt was always random.</p>
<p>We replaced it with this code:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It used to generate about 100 IDs per second.  Now it can do 175,000 per second.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a trivia question (to which I currently do not know the answer) inspired by the Red Sox&rsquo;s recent World Series win and what I can only hope is soon to be the unbeaten 9-0 Patriots.  If you take the 4 major American team professional sports championships (Stanley Cup, World Series, Superbowl, NBA Finals<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[1]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), what&rsquo;s the longest streak of consecutive championships in one metropolitan area?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[1]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - Is it just me, or does basketball not have a very recognizable term for its championship?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - I&rsquo;m willing to be relatively flexible with the definition of &ldquo;metropolitan area&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Answers below the fold!</p>
<p>There are a number of issues that make this question less than straightforward to answer.  Firstly, before 1915, the Stanley cup was only contested on a challenge basis (similar to the way that chess and boxing are done today).  Since the challenges weren&rsquo;t annual, and there were a lot of times that the challenger was crushed outright, I&rsquo;m going to ignore those years.  Second, the question of how far back to look comes up.  There&rsquo;s never been a streak of more than two consecutive championships in the same area as long as all four contests have existed in their current form (the Superbowl, started in 1968, is the youngest).</p>
<p>Not counting pre-1915 hockey, there have been three times that there have been streaks of three.  In 1906-1908, the Chicago White Sox won the World Series once and the Cubs won twice, and none of the others existed.  In 1927, the New York Yankees won the World Series, and then in 1928 the Rangers won the Stanley Cup and the Yankees won again.  In 1932-33, New York repeated the feat with the Yankees, Rangers, and the (baseball) Giants.</p>
<p>There has almost been one streak of three since 1968, but it requires that we make the cognitive leap to assuming that San Francisco and Los Angeles are a single metropolitan area.  And I think that in terms of sports affinity, it&rsquo;s a hard case to make.  But in 1988, the Lakers won the NBA Finals, the Dodgers won the World Series, and then in early 1989 the 49ers took home the Lombardi Trophy.</p>

			 <p>Sometime during the planning of our two parallel Halloween parties, Chris and I realized we needed some way to allow the two groups to communicate.  Videocasting was our first thought, but we didn&rsquo;t have the equipment or the knowledge.  But when it came to taking photos and putting them on websites, we had all kinds of both.  Using something Chris had written a while ago as a guide, I wrote a quick script to pull the photos off the camera, resize them to a reasonable resolution, and upload them to our web server.  I then wrote a CGI that would pick a random photo from each location and place them side-by-side.  Chris asked me to make the algorithm weight towards newer photos, which was far easier than it would have been if we had been uploading to a service like Flickr or something.</p>
<p>After a rough (and late) start in Boston, things went well.  Philly took some naughty shots early, which got people riled up here and for a period of time, things were pretty lewd.  Eventually it became family-safe fun time party photos and some gentle photo-jabs were traded between the sister parties.  Sometime around midnight, Chris texted me &ldquo;this is the best thing we&rsquo;ve ever done.&rdquo;  I agree.  That said, we learned things.  The script had all kinds of bugs (mostly because I wrote it without having the camera we were going to use or the software).  The CGI was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->too<!-- raw HTML omitted --> weighted towards new photos.  And whereas Chris had done this before and had a neat photobooth setup (a side room, tripod, IR trigger), Boston had a camera that had to be hand-shot and plugged back into the laptop every few minutes.</p>
<p>Will we ever be able to learn from the mistakes we made, and try out a new iteration of the script?  I certainly hope so.  Maybe we can hook in a third city.  California friends, I&rsquo;m gesturing in your direction.</p>

			 <p>Boston has been considering linking the two halves of its weird bus/subway hybrid Silver Line for a while now.  The so-called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phase III project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has gone through several designs and redesigns, one of which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->called for<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a 0.6-mile long tunnel for a cost of $780 million ($1.3B per mile).  More recent proposals were saner and cheaper, but people who live downtown complain about the added traffic and noise of articulated buses that hardly anyone uses anyway.</p>
<p>But that got me thinking: That&rsquo;s just a bus tunnel.  How does that cost (nearly a quarter-million dollars per foot!) compare to historical Boston subway projects?  The red line was extended in the early 80&rsquo;s from Harvard Square to Alewife.  That 3.2 mile extension <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cost $579 million<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, including three new stations.  In today&rsquo;s dollars, that&rsquo;d be about $459 million per mile, or about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one third<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the price of that Silver Line plan.  Sure, a tunnel through downtown would be a more complex project, but that seems extreme.</p>
<p>And for the anti-drivers in the audience, for the cost of the Big Dig (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->$14.6 billion, and it&rsquo;s not yet done<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), Boston could have built 31.8 miles of subway including 30 new stations.  That&rsquo;d reach to Nashua.</p>

			 <p>Western Massachusetts has several notable mountains.  The highest mountain in the state (Mt. Greylock) is there.  More interestingly, Mt. Frissell, whose southern slope contains the highest point in Connecticut (Bear Mountain, the highest peak in CT, is about 50 feet lower) is in the Southwestern corner.  There is another summit nearby that induces the exact same reaction from every single person.  That mountain is Mt. Everett.  [pause for audience pun]  No, Mt. Ever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ett<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>INSERT_MAP</p>
<p>The hike from Jug End Rd in Great Barrington to the peak of Mt. Everett is a moderate 9.2-mile round trip (it took us just under 6 hours).  The beginning of the hike features some rock scrambling and some confusing switchbacks.  Enough people have missed the switchbacks that the ground is worn in a trail-like manner going in the wrong direction.  For the first mile or so, make sure to pay careful attention to the white blazes.  You&rsquo;ll get to the top of a ridge that would have had some great views if it wasn&rsquo;t the hottest, humidest, haziest day of the year.  At about the 4-mile mark, you arrive at Guilder Pond, a really fantastic swimming hole.  If it&rsquo;s a hot day, bring a pair of trunks and a towel and a water filter.  You&rsquo;ll be glad you did.  (We didn&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>The top of Mt. Everett is actually pretty dull.  The fire tower was torn down in 2003, and all that&rsquo;s left is the foundation.  By the time you get to the pond, you&rsquo;ve already climbed most of the way up.  The 360-degree view looks like it&rsquo;s probably pretty great on clear days.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note: I realized the other day that M and I do a whole lot of hiking.  I want to start writing up some of them here 1) for posterity, 2) for future reference, and 3) so you and random Googlers can use our experience to plan hikes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Mount Katahdin has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the hardest mountains in the Northeast.  M and I hiked it last week, planning about a 7-mile day.  We got up at 7 to read the weather forecast on the Ranger&rsquo;s cabin, and hiked the 3.3 miles to the Chimney Pond campsite in the south basin.  We dropped off our tent, sleeping stuff, clothes, and one of our packs.  Around 10am, we started up Pamola trail.  It was 1.3 miles and 2000 vertical feet up that trail to our first peak.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>What we learned is that the trail up Pamola is perilous, windy, totally exposed, ridiculously steep, and covered with pointy and scratchy boulders.  We rock scrambled at a 45 degree angle hundreds and thousands of feet above the foothills for nearly three hours.  Yes, that&rsquo;s right, it took us three hours to climb a mile and a third.</p>
<p>At the peak, we reconsidered our options.  We were tired.  No, wait, we were exhausted.  We agreed that it very likely had been the hardest hike of our lives, and it was shorter than the distance from our house to Boston Common.  Coming up was the most notorious stretch of trail on Katahdin: the Knife Edge.  It&rsquo;s a rocky trail about three feet wide at parts the follows a sharp ridge between Pamola, Chimney Peak, South Peak, and the top of the mountain: Baxter Peak.  After some math, we took the optimistic route: continue the plan.</p>
<p>We started heading to the opposite side of the peak, and then we saw it.  Not just the Knife Edge, but the first hurdle on it: the Chimney.  A 200 foot precipitious drop that we needed to rockclimb down and then the same on the other side to get back up.  But we weren&rsquo;t ready for it.  We tried a couple different ways down, struggling against tired muscles.  We sat staring at it, weighing our other options.  It cut a deep groove directly between Pamola and the rest of the peaks, so we couldn&rsquo;t go around.</p>
<p>We were beaten by Katahdin.  We turned around, heading back down Pamola trail, and the whole way down we had to hope we wouldn&rsquo;t fall off the pointy and scratchy boulders.</p>

			 <p>The release of a beta of Apple&rsquo;s Safari for Windows earlier this week has resulted in an interesting flurry of activity in web designer circles.  Nevermind the instant security bugs and the quick release of fixes from Apple.  I&rsquo;m talking about typography.</p>
<p>The day that the beta came out, Jeff Atwood <!-- raw HTML omitted -->asked &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Apple&rsquo;s font rendering?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  He pointed out that others had discussed this before, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the difference was visible side-by-side on the exact same machine with the exact same fonts (and with presumably the exact same font libraries) that it became truly surprising.  Joel Spolsky <!-- raw HTML omitted -->responded with the answer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Apple and Microsoft have very different priorities when it comes to font rendering, and at current screen sizes and resolutions, Apple&rsquo;s total respect for the letter shapes can mean blurriness.  Their diligence becomes especially impressive when you consider the work that Apple must have had to go through to get Safari to run on Microsoft&rsquo;s home turf but render fonts the way it would on Mac OS X.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Shea piped in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with his own opinion and a caveat: I like Mac&rsquo;s look better, but I think Microsoft&rsquo;s is a better choice for the medium.  But more importantly, he points out that as soon as higher-DPI screens are available, the whole question will be moot.  Microsoft&rsquo;s deference to the pixel grid will be essentially meaningless.  Which brings us back to what Jeff Atwood does best: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a big post with research and quotes and numbers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> showing how far screens have come since the release of the PC AT and Macintosh.

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[1]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The always brilliant Joel ends with a great metaphor about how people usually prefer what&rsquo;s familiar.  He doesn&rsquo;t say it, but I think he was implying that this is a big contributor to entrenchment in computing holywars: Mac vs. PC, vi vs. emacs, KNF vs. OTBS.</p>

			 <p>The following is a classic science post I wrote for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->coolass metablog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in May 2004.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sometime last week, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Penta Water<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was introduced to our group.  Not having any on hand, and only having vague second-hand assertions of &ldquo;five-molecule water&rdquo;, the usual response was &ldquo;What, it&rsquo;s just a very small quantity of water?&rdquo;  Based on the assumption that it was probably five-<!-- raw HTML omitted -->atom<!-- raw HTML omitted --> water (since that made slightly more sense to us), theories ranged from &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a liquid with a different molecular makeup but similar characteristics to H<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->O,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Maybe they count disassociated Na<!-- raw HTML omitted -->+<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Cl<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ions from a tiny amount of salt in the water as two additional atoms,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s total bullshit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The key to unlocking this marketing mumbo jumbo is understanding water.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The past decade or so has seen a small group of physicists and chemists <!-- raw HTML omitted -->trying to answer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> some of the most fundamental, yet troubling, questions about what liquid water is.  For example, no calculation or model has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> been able to explain exactly why water has such high surface tension.  Similarly, no one knows why water can hold so much energy (i.e., why it&rsquo;s specific heat is so large).  These and more esoteric questions about water have led these scientists to try to model how water molecules interact.</p>
<p>Because of their strongly polar nature, water molecules seem to spontaneously form structures, and although usually these structures are random and tree-shaped, sometimes they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are ringed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  These rings are called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->isotopomers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and can take the form of tetramers (4), pentamers (5), hexamers (6), and even larger.  It&rsquo;s important to understand that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> water forms these structures spontaneously and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->transiently<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (generally on the order of picoseconds).</p>
<p>From here, we go from hard science into marketron land.  Penta claims that their water is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so pure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so free of impurities, so well filtered, that the molecules in their water forms smaller water clusters.  They then go on to say that smaller water clusters are more easily absorbed by the cells in your body, and thus that drinking their water is somehow more &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I will allow the reader to draw their own conclusion as to the validity of these statements.  Penta has links to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->research<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ldquo;supporting&rdquo; their claims, but I am neither a physicist or a chemist.  I would be unlikely to go any further than suggesting that Penta is probably no worse than any other filtered bottled water.</p>

			 <p>For the last year or so, I&rsquo;ve been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Planet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to aggregate my del.icio.us links (white background), Flickr photos (blue), blog posts (yellow), and recently Last.fm music history (tiny text with eighth notes).  I knew from day one that there were a few shortcomings, but I was able to code around most of them, like collapsing multiple consecutive items from the same source into one (like how photos show up with &ldquo;and 3 more&rdquo;).  And I needed to write plutor.org <!-- raw HTML omitted -->twice<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in two totally different templating languages.  But in the last few weeks, several minor annoyances have become bigger.  I never liked having my archives across several different sites.  And some feeds are too short (Flickr, occasionally, but definitely Last.fm).  Since planet was totally stateless, and just grabbed the RSS on every execution, once something fell off the source feed, it&rsquo;d be gone.  Even if it didn&rsquo;t yet need to fall off plutor.org.</p>
<p>Starting today, I&rsquo;m using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FeedWordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to import these external feeds directly into Wordpress.  No more Planet necessary.  There&rsquo;s a totally separate list of things I need to code around, and some of them are less trivial than they used to be.  But I&rsquo;m hoping that getting that data pulled into Wordpress will allow me to make plutor.org even more complete than it already is.  Twitter?  Netflix?  What else can I integrate?</p>

			 <p>When M and I were recently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->visiting Denver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we ended up walking into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Savory Spice Shop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in downtown Littleton.  Walking in the door, I was thinking it would be dull and quick.  But they pounced on us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then we started smelling and sampling, and we were almost instantly won over.  They had like ten types of cinnamon (and the cassia was labeled accurately!), six or seven different whole chilies, all kinds of rubs and pickling seasonings and mustards and whole dried herbs and extracts and some special salt-free blends.  And several different sizes of garlic powder, including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->High Bulk Index<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is more densely flavorful and integrates in much faster.  We ended up buying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unbelievable Saigon cinnamon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->smoked hot paprika<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (man, hot paprika is hard to find), and peppercorns.  And thank god they sell everything online, because I can guarantee we&rsquo;ll be buying more.</p>
<p>I can also guarantee we would have been in and out in like 20 seconds if it wasn&rsquo;t for their brilliant tasting policy.</p>

			 <p>Famed Physicist Richard Feynman once joked that he wanted to memorize π up to the 762nd digit.  Why?  Because that&rsquo;s where pareidolia kicks in, and the digits appear to briefly coalesce into rationality:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.1415926535 8979323846 â€¦ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[727 digits]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> â€¦ 9605187072 1134<!-- raw HTML omitted -->999999<!-- raw HTML omitted --> â€¦<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>He would end a hypothetical recitation at that point, the implication being that from there on the decimal repeats.  Virtually everyone, obviously including Feynman, knows π is both irrational and transcendental, and thus such a fact is impossible.  The so-called &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feynman Point<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; is the first incidence of six consecutive identical digits in π and it also happens to be the first incidence of four and five consecutive digits.</p>
<p>Happy Pi Day.</p>

			 <p>In November, I participated in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->National Novel Writing Month<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Sadly, I only made it about 2500 words in before getting wrapped up in, whaddyacallit, you know, life.  I&rsquo;m glad I gave it a brief whirl, but I hope to give it a better thrashing in 2007.  Here&rsquo;s the dull introduction to my half-plotted story, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Assuming Perfection<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unless you were there on a Saturday morning. It wasnâ€™t so much ritual as it was habit. The lawn mower was dustedâ€”yes, dustedâ€”and brought to the driveway. The hinges and screws and belts were checked. The gas tank was topped off, and the oil was as well. And only then, the lawn was mowed; not immaculately, but diligently.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the edger came out. The steps were the same. And the blade touched the grass and did what edgers do. And before the edger or the lawn mower went away, they were wiped, occasionally scrubbed, and always oiled (to prevent rusting).</p>
<p>Saturdays were spent cleaning, and Sundays were for shopping. A manâ€™s home is never finished, Roland would say. Nothing was ever quite right: the front door was the wrong shade of blue one week, and the knocker clashed. The sprinkler did the ksh-ksh-ksh a little too fast, and watered in a thoroughly disorganized manner. Shoes got scuffed, socks got worn through. And even the most stylish of men tired of the same style clothes.</p>
<p>This particular Sunday, Roland had come back home with deceptively full bags. They contained a number of pillows of differing thicknesses and materials. He had stood at the store, trying to imagine sleeping. The mattresses and the pillows were, perplexingly, halfway across the store from each other, which had made the task a greater challenge.</p>
<p>â€œHow am I to know whether Iâ€™m a side sleeper or a back sleeper?â€ he had thought. â€œI know how I wake up. And I know how I am most comfortable when I am trying to fall asleep. But they are not the same. How can I be sure whichâ€”if eitherâ€”is the way I spend most of the night?â€</p>
<p>He considered returning home to set up a video camera to watch himself sleep that night. â€œBut,â€ he reasoned quietly, â€œwould being conscious of the video taping make me self-conscious of the way Iâ€™m laying? Will I sleep the way Iâ€™m most comfortable sleeping? Or will I sleep the way Iâ€™m most comfortable being watched? Once the camera is off and the pillow is decided on, I may regret it.â€ And he didnâ€™t like the idea of keeping the camera in his room for the rest of his life, just to be sure of getting a satisfactory nightâ€™s sleep.</p>
<p>Roland had tried to try each pillow in the store, pressing it against his head in a manner which roughly approximated sleeping at home. It wasnâ€™t long before he realized that the uncontrolled factorsâ€”the plastic wrapper around the pillow, the inability to actually lay down, the way he could only support a portion of the bottom of the pillow with his armsâ€”meant that this method of gaining information was a futile effort at best.</p>
<p>In the end, he had decided on a rare course of action: he purchased four entirely different pillows. He felt he had had little choice in the matter. The storeâ€™s poor layout made it impossible to make a firm decision. And even then, he couldnâ€™t unwrap the pillows. He would just have to return next week with the pillows he disliked.</p>
<p>Although Roland normally would have felt defeated by having to resort to a purchase that he was sure he would not keep, in this case he returned home in high spirits.</p>
<p>Rolandâ€™s house sat at a dead end at the very top of a small, bare hill, not far from the center of town. It wasnâ€™t very large, but his continuous upkeep and desire for improvement gave it the appearance of an illustration, not of reality. Like the yard, the trees and gardens were well-maintained. The tall brown fence kept the neighborhood dogsâ€™ trouble out. Roland himself had always feared being a poor pet-owner, and had never got up the courage to even seriously consider the idea.</p>
<p>Roland returned home to a dark home at the tail end of dusk. He closed the garage doors, noting again that the loud motor needed to be re-oiled before too long. From the driveway, he walked the brick walkway to his front door, unlocked, and entered.</p>
<p>When he turned the light on, he saw exactly what he always expected to see: the main stairway leading directly from the front door, straight up to the second floor. To his left was his living room, where he occasionally would spend an evening reading and where he planned to disassemble and rebuild the garage door opener. To the right of the stairs was a door to a coat closet hardly large enough to hold his three coats.</p>
<p>He walked past the living room to the kitchen. He felt a pang of guilt over having spent a small fortune on the dark granite countertop, and he tried to think consciously about how much it increased the resale value of the house. That, the stainless steel fridge and the island with the six-burner stove made this a kitchen he was quite proud of.</p>
<p>Upstairs, in the only bedroom, he placed the two bags of pillows on the floor. He had been thinking since he left the store how he was going to schedule the pillow testing. Seven clearly does not divide easily into four. How sure could he be after a single nightâ€™s sleep that any one pillow was or was not satisfactory enough? Should he set an alarm for halfway through the night so he could switch pillows?</p>
<p>He discarded that last thought with a quiet chuckle.</p>
<p>The plan Roland had settled on was this: he would give each pillow a single nightâ€™s sleep as a preliminary test. He felt there was a good chance that heâ€™d be able to discard at least one of pillows as completely unacceptable after that short period of time, and would give each of the remaining pillows at least one additional night. He wasnâ€™t sure what he would do at the end of the seven nights if he was unable to make a final choice, but Roland was confident he could determine a plan of action at that point if it became necessary.</p>
<p>While preparing for bed, Roland made a mental inventory of the things he had done during the weekend. His father had drilled this into him as a child: â€œFloss your teeth, Roland, what did you have for breakfast yesterday?â€ Eggs, sunny side up; toast with raspberry jam; cottage cheese, small curd. â€œNow brush, where did you go this afternoon?â€ To the barber, then to the laundromat to do a load of whites with bleach, then home to put a second coat of varnish on the front stairwayâ€™s left railing. â€œUse the toilet, how many tomato seedlings did you plant in the front garden?â€ Seven. And four basil seedlings, and a full package of trellis cucumbers in the rear. â€œWash your hands and face, which pillow are you going to sleep on tonight?â€</p>
<p>Roland stood in the bathroom doorway, hands and face unwashed, staring at the four pillows lined up on his blue duvet. As far as he was concerned, they were all the same. He was equally torn between all of them. And now that they were disassociated from the signs at the store, he couldnâ€™t even decide based on their ascribed qualities.</p>
<p>â€œIâ€™ll flip two coins of differing denominations. One will be head-head. One head-tail. One tail-head. And the last tail-tail. Iâ€™ll do this each night, reflipping until I get a pillow I havenâ€™t slept on yet.â€</p>
<p>Having decided, he washed his face and hands, dug a quarter and a nickel out of his coin sorter, and flipped them. Both heads. Lucky.</p>
<p>He got into bed, not with the pillow he wanted, but with the pillow he had. And he turned off the lights and slept terribly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The highway was packed, as always. The grit and the smoke and the smog and the general filth and stagnant air of the city forced Roland to keep the windows closed today. It was the first beautiful spring day of the year, as far as he could remember, but even if he could bring himself to crack open the windows on his red Honda, heâ€™d regret it. The air was unpleasantly warmed by burning hydrocarbons and the sound was filled with the ruckus of the city. He knew this. It wasnâ€™t new, but today made it sadder than usual.</p>
<p>He only had to drive twenty miles to work, but it usually took him two hours in the morning, and two more in the evening. There were other commuting options, of course. There always are. He could have taken the bus. Forget it, on the bus he couldnâ€™t block out the city, it would be pressing against him and sitting next to him. Or worse yet it would be standing in front of his seat, and his eyes would be staring at its butt for an hour. He tried the bus once. Only once.</p>
<p>He had carpooled for a while with an Accountant who worked just a mile away from his own job. They shared driving responsibilities, but with that came a compromise that Roland found difficult to accept. It felt the same and looked the same, but his environment was not his own. He shared it with Bill. There was no huge serious gaping problem, but there were little things. He never felt entirely comfortable, and for four hours of every day, he was on edge.</p>
<p>He could switch jobs, and find something closer to his house. â€œYes, that is an option, Roland,â€ heâ€™d tell himself. â€œIf it ever gets really bad, you can quit.â€ Four hours was bad, but it wasnâ€™t really bad.</p>
<p>Roland got off at his exit, and slowly made his way down the surface streets to the misshapen brick building where Slingstonâ€™s offices were located. There was a yellow car in the spot where he always parked. A dented yellow sedan. He couldnâ€™t determine the make; the emblems were gone, and there were rust spots where the bolts previously keeping them attached had punctured the body. The yellow was not even a uniform yellow: it was stained as if with cigarette smoke. No, he corrected himself, exhaust. As far as he could tell, it had parked on the side of the highway, bathed in exhaust for the entire fifteen years since it was constructed. Then, someone found it, was unable to get it started, so kicked it all the way here. And left it in Rolandâ€™s spot.</p>
<p>It was only 8:30, so there were still plenty of extra spots in the parking lot. Roland wasnâ€™t sure which were taken, and he briefly debated taking the one just to the left of his. But will that person understand? Will she end up parking next to her? Will it domino and spiral out of control and lead to parking lot chaos?</p>
<p>Tired and reluctantly, Roland parked at the end of the parking lot. It wasnâ€™t the farthest spot from the door, but it was far enough that he felt confident that no one would be disturbed by the change. Or, at least, no one else.</p>
<p>Coffee and briefcase in hand, he paused at the top of the fireproof stairwell. The door that led to Slingston was just feet away from the door in front of him. He listened, surprised. He could hear laughter. Raucous. Roaring. A caliber of laughter that was entirely inappropriate for a Monday morning. It was surprising: the other clients on the fourth floor were fairly button-down. There was a small but influential venture capital firm, a paper-products reseller, and a customer service call-center for Hewlett-Packard. One of the last in the western hemisphere, he was told in the strictest of confidence.</p>
<p>He couldnâ€™t come up with a likely reason for any of them to be laughing so loud so early. It died down before he could identify the direction. Sticking his head out of the stairwell into the hallway didnâ€™t help. It was gone.</p>
<p>Roland turned to his left, and opened the door to suite 403.</p>
<p>â€œRoland!â€ hollered a voice, behind which was a face of a stranger.</p>
<p>â€œOh.. um.. er,â€ Roland looked again at the door to verify that he had opened the right one. He didnâ€™t recognize the face, but he did recognize the voice. It was owned by the same person who had been laughing.</p>
<p>â€œOh, Roland, youâ€™re in the right place.â€ Standing up from where he had been seated behind the strange man was Abraham Slingston, the large, fifty-something scruffy namesake, owner, and operating manager of Slingston. â€œThis is just Drew. Drew, Iâ€™d like you to meet Roland, the finest architect this side of the mighty Pacific.â€</p>
<p>â€œEr..â€ Roland was equally thrown off balance by the unexpected stranger, the unbidden complement, and the gigantic smile strewn across Abeâ€™s face. Somehow, it turned him from a stern old man into a jolly grandfatherly figure. â€œUh..â€ Roland just stared at the hand Drew was offering him.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s a great pleasure to finally meet you, Roland. Youâ€™re taller than I was expecting. Abe, why didnâ€™t you tell me how huge this man was? What are you, six-six?â€</p>
<p>As soon as Drew seemed to get used to the idea that he was far too surprised to shake his hand, something got unstuck in Rolandâ€™s mind. He reached forward and took it. His mouth wasnâ€™t yet ready to listen to his brain, but at the very least he could handle being cordial.</p>
<p>â€œI met Drew this weekend in the mountains. I was skiing, he was snowboarding, and, well, pow!â€ Abe punched his two fists together to demonstrate. â€œNeither of us were really hurt, but the ski patrol saw it and they made big deal about bringing us to the lodge and checking us over. We just started chatting, and by the time they were satisfied we were okay, we realized how much we really had in common!â€</p>
<p>â€œOh.. er, hi.â€ Roland took a step forward and let the door swing closed. He realized he was still holding it open, and there was no reason to bother the rest of the floor with this racket. It was, Roland reminded himself, still before nine on a Monday morning.</p>
<p>â€œHey, there, stranger, sorry for scaring you like that the moment you came in the door!â€ Drew patted him on the shoulder and moved towards the door. But instead of leaving, he bent down to pick something up.</p>
<p>â€œHere you go.â€ Rolandâ€™s travel mug was in his hand. The handle was broken.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wisdom of Crowds<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by James Surowiecki <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(22 July 2006 - 7 August 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This book, along with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Freakonomics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blink<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, are the three books that took the blogging world by storm in 2005.  The latter and the former are clearly applicable in social-network and website design.  Somehow, I missed this one last year.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Minority Report and Other Classic Stories<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Philip K. Dick <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(10 August 2006 - 23 August 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;d never actually read a single Philip K. Dick story.  I came across this while I was wandering through the library, so I grabbed it.  Reading Science Fiction from the 1960&rsquo;s is unlike reading anything else.  The state of instability in real-life scientific progress during the Cold War makes everything seem so out-of-place.  Dick&rsquo;s drug use, schizophrenia, and escalating psychosis definitely show through, but it never affected his ability to write a great story.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sundiver<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by David Brin <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(29 August 2006 - 11 September 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Science Fiction, at it&rsquo;s best, is not about science.  It&rsquo;s about society.  I had read something about David Brin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Uplift Saga&rdquo; at some point, and it sounded interesting.  The social dynamics in a universe where entire species are voluntarily subservient to others for millennia are fascinating and complicated.  This is a great detective story.  (I started to read the second book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Startide Rising<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but my heart wasn&rsquo;t in the story.)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Ken Jennings <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(14 October 2006 - 21 October 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I follow <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ken&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and subscribe to his weekly trivia mailing list.  I knew he was funny, intelligent, and a great writer, so reading this book was a no-brainer.  It alternates between a memoir of his Jeopardy rise-to-fame and an investigation into the history and spread of the trivia phenomenon.  He even goes to a Boston-area trivia night!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Einstein: A Life in Science<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Michael White and John Gribbin <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(24 October 2006 - 27 October 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I finished <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brainiac<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the plane on the way to Spain, so I had to keep an eye out for English-language bookstores.  When I finally found one, it was in Gibraltar.  Einstein&rsquo;s an interesting figure.  It&rsquo;s somewhat jarring to realize how young he was when he made his primary contributions (he was only 26 in his &ldquo;Annus Mirabilis&rdquo;) and how quickly physics ran, yes, beyond his comprehension.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma : A Natural History of Four Meals<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Michael Pollan <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(15 November 2006 - 12 December 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is the second of the two books I would pick to recommend strongly.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an in-depth look at how the food we buy at the grocery store gets there, and the role that historical happenstance has played in the development of the current American&rsquo;s diet.  Supermarket &ldquo;Organic&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t as different from non-organic as you think.</p>

This book was one of the most enlightening I&rsquo;ve read in a long time.  Although I was alive for a little more than a year of his administration, I have no recollection of it.  In fact, in the political atmosphere I&rsquo;ve been aware of (essentially the past five years), the idea of a deeply religious southerner who is intensely liberal and libertarian has seemed like a fairy tale.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->V for Vendetta<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Alan Moore and David Lloyd <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(5 Jan 2006 - 9 Jan 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My sister-in-law, Shaun, gave me the comic book just a few months before the movie came out.  And I&rsquo;m glad she did, because the book&rsquo;s plot is deeper and its philosophy is far more Anarchist.  I might be willing to go so far to say that it&rsquo;s a totally different message with a fairly similar story.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Charles C. Mann <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(28 Jan 2006 - 4 Mar 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
If I had to suggest one book to read based on my list from this year, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to.  But if I was allowed to suggest two, this would be one of them.  It&rsquo;s somewhat amazing to hear that there were likely more people in the Americas than there were in Europe, Asia, and Africa in the 15th century.  Corn was mankind&rsquo;s first GMO.  Oh, and learn the dirty politics behind Squanto aiding the pilgrims.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by John Allen Paulos <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(12 Jan 2006 - 28 Jan 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is another book I can&rsquo;t remember.  I was waiting for an interlibrary loan, and had to kill some time.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Mil Millington <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(10 Mar 2006 - 28 Mar 2006)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
As I said <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in January<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Mil Millington&rsquo;s humor is canonical English.  Dry and sarcastic, but also silly and exagerrated.  This book gets wilder as the main character&rsquo;s life spins beyond his control, but I smiled through every single page.  Absolutely strongly recommended.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->GÃ¶del Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Douglas R. Hofstadter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(3 Apr 2006 - 22 July 2006, holy cow)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This book took me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forever<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  To be perfectly honest, I skipped a couple chapters in the middle and at the very end.  His discussions about mathematical language systems and especially Gödel&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem are invaluable.  They reminded me a lot about one big part of school I miss: true theory.</p>

			 <p>Would I be embarrassing myself if I admitted I didn&rsquo;t get the notorious xkcd <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make me a sandwich<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comic?  (Now being made into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a t-shirt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, due to its popularity.)

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s probably #1, but Bob&rsquo;s first response is poorly composed.  Part of the allure of xkcd is the off-the-cuff style, evident in the stick figures, but in this case, I think spending a few more minutes considering the dialogue would have been worth it.</p>

			 <p>Anyone with more than a passing familiarity with baseball knows that there&rsquo;s at least one important rule difference between the American League and the National League: in the AL, the pitcher never bats, and is instead represented by the Designated Hitter, a player who never takes the field.  Interestingly, the rule that governs this is 6.10, which begins by stating &ldquo;Any League may elect to use the Designated Hitter Rule.&rdquo;  Apparently the NL has simply elected not to use it.  More interestingly, there are a few minor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->official rules<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that specifically apply to only NL or AL teams:</p>

			 <p>On the side of a non-descript road in sleepy Cumberland, Rhode Island is a little bar with a tiny parking lot.  From the outside, it looks like the kind of bar you&rsquo;ve driven by a hundred times: dark, walls grey with pre-ban cigarette smoke, exactly three taps of American rice-heavy beer, NLCS playing on the fuzzy television in the corner.  The name — Pitcher&rsquo;s Pub — is even a beer/baseball pun.  But despite its unassuming outward appearance, this bar is different.  You sit down, yes, next to the Golden Tee game.  You shout your order to the waitress over, it&rsquo;s true, the Tom Petty cover band that non-traditionally includes a banjoist.  But when you start scanning the twenty-some taps and realize you only recognize half of them, you&rsquo;re willing to admit that your first impression might have been hasty.  And the orange bottled-beer menu packed with microbrews, barley wines, and bocks makes you glad you didn&rsquo;t judge this book by its cover.  In fact, you realize dizzily, you can only think of one bar in Boston with such a broad offering.</p>
<p>I felt the need to opine this morning because there&rsquo;s not a lot out there about this hidden gem.  There are some moderately positive <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reviews on Beer Advocate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that convinced us to give it a try.</p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s almost certainly the day.  With events planned for today in Japan and the US, and tomorrow in Europe, and pretty much all of the rumored launch dates mere weeks away, it looks like today&rsquo;s the day to finally hear details from Nintendo on the Wii&rsquo;s pricing and the list of launch titles.  And the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->true<!-- raw HTML omitted --> date.  I&rsquo;ll be updating this post as the day goes on.</p>
<p>Right now, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wii.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is live, but only the Japanese section.  From the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Japanese event<!-- raw HTML omitted --> we know the price and date for Japan: 25000 yen on December 2.  Nintendo has previously said that they can&rsquo;t manage a simultaneous worldwide launch, but that all the major markets would be within a couple weeks.  That seems to indicate a late-November date for the US.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there will be only one Wii box at launch, but sadly it will have only one remote.  We also have Japan Virtual Console pricing deets (NES 500 yen, SNES 800 yen, N64 1000 yen; the equivalent of about 4, 7, and 9 dollars).</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest news I&rsquo;ve seen thus far is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->list of launch titles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  WarioWare, Monkey Ball, and Trauma Center should make this a killer investment in my house, but it&rsquo;s also very nice to know that Twilight Princess is going to be available at launch, despite some recent rumors to the contrary.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s hard to argue with the fact that Google has grown to the point where it can be a real challenge to compete with it.  The first public demonstration (in my memory) came this week when web calendar <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kiko<!-- raw HTML omitted --> went <!-- raw HTML omitted -->up for auction on eBay<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the obvious reaction was to think that it was killed by Google Calendar.  Paul Graham went so far to say that the big lesson here is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;to stay out of Google&rsquo;s way&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.   The Kiko team itself came away with some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rather different lessons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But I think that David Heinemeier over at 37signals <!-- raw HTML omitted -->said it best<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Google isn&rsquo;t the be-all end-all.  In fact, no one product or application or website will ever be the best thing for everyone.  There are plenty of Google applications (among them the Calendar), that while neat, don&rsquo;t suit my needs.  When people balked at this idea, claiming &ldquo;Google is big.  Backpack calendar is small.  They win, you just haven&rsquo;t realized it yet,&rdquo; Jason Fried piped up with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->defining your own success<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Success is not a zero-sum game.  Two competitors can both succeed.</p>

			 <p>Supposedly, there&rsquo;s going to be a new planet definition proposal made the IAU today.  Everyone thinks &ldquo;Pluto is a planet.  It just is, so whatever we propose needs to keep it a planet&rdquo;.  So the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new proposal also adds three new planets to the solar system<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Xena (that&rsquo;s 2003 UB<!-- raw HTML omitted -->313<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to you), Ceres (the first discovered and largest known asteroid-belt object), and even Pluto&rsquo;s moon Charon.    Under the proposed definition, &ldquo;A planet is a celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet.&rdquo;  What&rsquo;s that you ask?  Why does that make Charon a planet?  Well, it&rsquo;s because the barycenter for its orbit lies <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->above<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the surface of Pluto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It would now be considered a double-planet system.</p>
<p>The rule also introduces the likelihood of even more planets (like Quaoar and Orcus) once we have a better idea of their size and mass.  I definitely like some of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new terminology<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: a &ldquo;Pluton&rdquo; is any planet beyond Neptune.  We need to start working on a new mnemonic for MVEMCJSUNPCX.  Go.</p>

			 <p>Back in June, I came across a question on Ask MetaFilter about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->getting back into Magic: The Gathering<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and deck recommendations.  I had honestly thought about it from time to time.  I remembered the game being an interesting challenge, since you&rsquo;re never sure what the other guy&rsquo;s deck is going to do, and there&rsquo;s no way to be prepared for all of it.  I didn&rsquo;t want to fall head-first back into spending hundreds of dollars on the game, but if there was some way I could enjoy it on a limited basis, I was interested.  I noticed the poster was in Somerville, so although he wasn&rsquo;t soliciting players, I posted a comment indicating that I thought it was an excellent idea.  A couple of weeks later, he emailed me and invited me.  Yesterday, I went.</p>
<p>It was a just as much fun as I remember.  The pre-made &ldquo;theme decks&rdquo; they have nowadays make it really easy to spend $15 and have a great time.  I got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Code of the Orzhov<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the Guildpact expansion, a black and white weenie/whittle deck.  Some of the cards — like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Agent of Masks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — have effects that are really powerful in games that are larger than one-on-one.  I also got two boosters for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->booster draft<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and made a few tweaks to the deck after a couple of games, and I was really pleased.  I went 3-2 with my deck, a couple of which were very close games.  Not bad for it being seven years since I played the game.</p>

			 <p>Not many people know that there is very little copper in modern pennies.  In 1982, they were changed from 95% copper to simply copper-plated zinc.  If you cut open a penny made after that date, you&rsquo;d see the grey-colored metal on the inside.  In fact, in 1981, pennies of both recipes were made, and collectors have to listen to the sound they make when they bounce to tell the difference.  Do it yourself with a penny from the 70s and one from the 90s; the difference will be obvious.</p>
<p>The price of copper closed last night at $3.48 a pound.  That means that a 3.1 gram penny has about 2.26 cents of copper in it.  Melt down a big wad of those, and you can make yourself a tidy profit.  The price of zinc has been escalating in the last few months, too, so it might not be long until it&rsquo;s worthwhile to melt down new pennies, too.</p>

			 <p>Last night around 9, our water cut out.  I spoke to a couple neighbors and they had no water, either.  There was nothing about it on TV, and the Boston Water hotline was completely busy.

<p>M says that Mass Ave near BMC was still closed when she got in this morning, and their ER was evacuated and closed overnight.  And I think she said it still is.  Bad for patients, but good for her: it means she probably won&rsquo;t have to admit any patients today.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I got a new bike, and it&rsquo;s an adventure story.</p>
<p>Sometime last summer, on two separate occasions, we found two bicycles on the side of the road in Naugatuck with a free signs.  Neither was in great condition: they were dirty, rusty, and had flat tires.  For some reason, despite M&rsquo;s insistence that we start biking, they were put in our garage and ignored.  During her long period without school-work, however, she got them out and started cleaning and rebuilding one.  The other was discarded.  Before she could complete her work on it — or even put it all back together — we moved to Boston.  We brought the bike, in pieces, with us.</p>
<p>She dropped the pieces off at Federico&rsquo;s Bike Shop on Emerson St about half a mile away.  She had called ahead, but they still were surprised and amused by (what they called) the &ldquo;bike destroyer&rdquo;.  Our neighbor had warned us that they were slow there, and they were clearly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> busy, but it was okay; I had waited a year, so I wasn&rsquo;t really in any rush.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->They called a few weeks later to let us know that it was done and ready to be picked up.  For something like fourty dollars, they put it all back together, degreased and regreased the parts that needed it, and even replaced a couple damaged pieces.  I consider it a huge bargain.  M was working on a beautiful Sunday, so I decided to go pick it up and maybe bike to City Point.  With only a blank check and my phone in my pockets, I left home.  Immediately I realized that I was locked out.  After trying to break in through my own windows (I was unwilling to cut the screens) and thinking whether our upstairs neighbors could help (no, we haven&rsquo;t given them a spare key), I realized my only option was two miles away saving lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really great thing that I had what I had, because I was able to pay for the bike and ride it to the hospital.  It was a surprisingly smoooth experience, considering the fact that the bike wasn&rsquo;t really sized for me (the seat was too high and the handlebars too low), and I hadn&rsquo;t ridden a bike probably since high school.  I had no bike lock, so I had to wait outside, hot, thirsty, and feeling stupid while M did vastly more important things.  She eventually came out, deservedly berated me for my idiocy, and made me wear her helmet in punishment.  I have a massive noggin, and she does not, so it looked sort of like a strapped-on fez.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I suffered a flat tire on my way home.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a very long time since a Nintendo console was launched with a bundled game.  The last one was, believe it or not, the Super Nintendo (bundled with the pinnacle of platformers: Super Mario World) in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1991<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Wii Fanboy has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a great feature<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about &ldquo;Wii Sports&rdquo;, a collection of little games that was the centerpiece of Nintendo&rsquo;s E3 demos, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has been covered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in detail.  Could it be bundled with the Wii?  Should it be?</p>
<p>How console manufacturers can fail to bundle a game with the console is beyond me.  Console prices have gotten high enough.  Parents considering the purchase for their kids have to also pick a game or three to add to the tab?  Ridiculous.</p>

			 <p>M and I just got back from a four-night trip to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shenandoah National Park<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in northern Virginia.  I&rsquo;ve been talking about it with people this week, and I&rsquo;ve run out of positive adjectives.  It was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->remarkably amazing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in every way.</p>
<p>INSERT_MAP</p>
<p>Most of our trip we spent hiking: 7 or 8 miles each day.  Since we generally hiked from trailheads on Skyline Drive (the main 105-mile road running through the center of the park and the roughly along the ridge of the Blue Ridge Mountains) to waterfalls, just about every single one of the hikes was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->down<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for several miles, then back up.  Which was a strange thing to get used to.  The trails were probably the best-marked ones I&rsquo;ve ever hiked on.  Every mile or so, there would be a granite post in the ground with a metal band around the top.  The band would say what trail you were on and how far to other side-trails and destinations and whatnot.</p>
<p>The lodge we stayed in (Skyland) was great (and the view from the room was outstanding).  And the &ldquo;Early Bird&rdquo; special package (for going before their busy season) was really fantastic.  The weather could not have behaved any better while we were there.  Move-related problems meant we didn&rsquo;t have our digital camera with us, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the photos we took<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with film and my cellphone are definitely excellent.</p>
<p>I recommend this trip for anyone.  The lodge meant you didn&rsquo;t have to really be roughing it, but there&rsquo;s more than 500 miles of hiking to a whole lot of great mountaintops and waterfalls.  There&rsquo;s 75 stunning overlooks along the road alone, so if you&rsquo;re not even in a hiking mood, a drive through the park is also more than worth the time it takes.</p>

			 <p>MetaFilter — or more accurately <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AskMetaFilter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — is a thing of beauty.  Last week, after about a month of noticable deterioration, my DSL stopped functioning almost entirely.  I spent three hours on the phone with five different AT&amp;T helpdesk people until they finally decided to send out an engineer.  He showed up, plugged something into the wall, mumbled &ldquo;your modem is broken&rdquo; and left.  They wanted $100 to replace it, which I considered (information super-)highway robbery.</p>
<p>EBay <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has hundreds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of DSL modems listed for a lot less, and I decided I&rsquo;d get one there.  But I didn&rsquo;t know what to look for.  There are a lot of acronyms and whatnot, and I wasn&rsquo;t really interested in doing hard research and studying for a twenty-dollar piece of equipment that I only need for a few months.

			 <p>The biggest disadvantage to building your own desktop is that when things go wrong, you actually have to figure out what it is.  A couple weeks ago, in the middle of a game, my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> shut itself off.  It would no longer get so far as POSTing, and sometimes the power supply wouldn&rsquo;t do anything when I hit the power button.  After some fiddling, I determined that it was most likely the motherboard, and since I had a three-year warranty, I sent it back to MSI for repairs.</p>
<p>When a different motherboard (of the same model) came back, it still wasn&rsquo;t working.  This narrowed it down to the (cheap) power supply or the (less cheap) processor.  I randomly came across a great rebate deal on a 350W power supply at CompUSA, so I ran there and purchased it.  I was lucky, and that did it.  It only cost me ten dollars in the end, and my computer now seems quieter, too.</p>
<p>I only wish it hadn&rsquo;t taken a month.</p>

			 <p>Every time the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Powerball Lottery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> breaks two-hundred million or so, people at work start talking about it and emailing appeals for joining a lotto pool.  After I got sick of shaking my head at these people, I realized that it could possibly be worth it to buy a ticket.  Since the ticket price stays the same even as the jackpot grows, there&rsquo;s got to be a tipping point, beyond which the payoff from the average ticket is greater than one dollar.  But what is that point?  Should I be queuing up at the gas station right now?  Or should I wait until it hits ten digits?</p>
<p>Powerball <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tells you<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the odds of getting the grand prize are 1 in 146,107,962.  This gives us a good starting point.  In a universe without taxes, annuties or interest, a rational person wouldn&rsquo;t want to purchase a ticket until the jackpot was $146 million.  But we don&rsquo;t live in that universe, nor do I believe we&rsquo;ll be travelling to it to play the lottery.</p>
<p>To figure out the answer for us, we&rsquo;ll need to start by answering one quite difficult question: When they say &ldquo;estimated jackpot of&rdquo; whatever, how much of that is going to end up directly in your pocket?  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Powerball FAQ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> talks a bit about how the payoff works (towards the bottom).  The advertised estimated jackpot is the annuity, and it&rsquo;s usually about double the actual cash they have on-hand.  If you go for the lump-sum choice, you get that amount of cash (this week, about $150 million).  Interestingly, if you choose the annuity, they put that same pile of money into government bonds, and they pay you in 30 yearly installments, funded entirely from that investment.</p>
<p>This detail is important for two reasons.  First, even if you buy the same bonds the Powerball folks would have (which you can&rsquo;t, since you&rsquo;re a nobody schlub who thought the lottery was a decent investment decision), you end up with a lot less money by picking the lump sum.  They&rsquo;re able to buy the bonds without paying income taxes — which means far more interest.  Since it&rsquo;s income for you even before you can buy anything with it, you aren&rsquo;t so lucky.  Second, they don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;estimated jackpot&rdquo; because they&rsquo;re lazy; they say it because it&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->impossible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for anyone to say how bonds are going to behave for the next 30 years.  They couldn&rsquo;t tell you how much money you&rsquo;ll end up getting if they wanted to.  Which they probably don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this also makes things impossible for us to calculate accurately.  So we&rsquo;re going to have to be estimated it about it as well.  So let&rsquo;s say their double-the-lump-sum (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->L<!-- raw HTML omitted --> = <!-- raw HTML omitted -->J<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) guess is accurate.  Accepting the annuity, you end up with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->J<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/30<!-- raw HTML omitted --> per year.  This is (obviously) going to put you in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->top tax bracket<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: 35%.  Which means that only about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1 - 0.35) * (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->J<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/30)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is yours, per year.  A little simple arithmetic brings us to the conclusion that J must be at least $224 million.</p>
<p>But what have I forgotten?  I&rsquo;ll give you a moment to consider what I&rsquo;ve looked at so far.  Hundreds of millions of dollars.  Decades of interest.  A dope with a little slip of paper and Hurley&rsquo;s numbers.  Got it, yet?  It&rsquo;s Carter&rsquo;s Bane, better known as inflation.  The Department of Labor follows inflation using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Consumer Price Index<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a complicated formula of a whole bunch of items that pretty much everyone pays for: food, gas, housing, clothes, silly hats, medical care, etc.  Looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a summary table<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of CPI indexes, the average inflation rate for the past decade has been just over 2.5% year to year.</p>
<p>What does this mean?  It means that in 2036, when you&rsquo;re getting your very last annuity, although it&rsquo;s (more or less) exactly the same number of dollars, it&rsquo;ll be worth less than half as much as your first one (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1-2.5%)^29 = 0.48<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  And your total?  Knowing that we want $146 million at the end, we can calculate for J in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Σ(<!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->=[0,29]) of ((1-2.5%)^<!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)<em>((1 - 0.35)</em>(<!-- raw HTML omitted -->J<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/30))<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and we get a final answer of $316,822,280.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don&rsquo;t run out to buy any tickets right now.  But if no one wins tonight, you might want to get some for next Saturday&rsquo;s drawing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is a really strange development that requires some pondering and discussion.  An expansion for Half-Life 2 has been in development for a while (previously named <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aftermath<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  Reportedly, it follows Alyx (and, some reports say, Gordon) escaping from the devastation immediately following the end of Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>But last week, things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->got weird<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Valve renamed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aftermath<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Half-Life 2: Episode One<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Doug Lombardi is being terse at the moment, but this appears to indicate intent to release regular episodic content.  In general, this is a good thing, but I have a number of concerns.</p>
<p>The first concern is with naming.  What is the &ldquo;original&rdquo; Half-Life 2, chopped liver?  Episode Zero?  Does anyone remember the naming scheme of the series that started with Dark Forces?  First, there was Dark Forces.  Then, there was Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight.  Then there was Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast.  Then, well, they decided to stick with Jedi Knight, which I think was a good idea.  I predict that it won&rsquo;t be long until there are sub-subtitles (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Half-Life 2: Episode Three: Return of the Snarks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) or they abandon the episode number altogether.  (As a side note, for the nerd subculture, the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Episode Foo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; scheme invokes too much Star Wars Prequelism to be anything but unsettling.)</p>
<p>But the bigger problem I see is Valve&rsquo;s rampant perfectionism, and thus their inability to deliver a game on time since, well, the first Half-Life.  Sure, this is inarguably a Good Thing™ when it comes to game quality.  But when you make a promise to release regular content (especially if you charge per-&ldquo;episode&rdquo;), you need to do it.  And that means cutting corners.  It&rsquo;s taken them a year and a half to release <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aftermath<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  How long will Episode Two take?</p>

<p>The answer is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Seikilos epitaph<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a 2000-year-old tombstone in Turkey with a song written on it, even including Greek lyrics.

<p>The other day, he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posted about<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Evolution versus Intelligent Design debate.  He didn&rsquo;t debate the issue, mind you (he says &ldquo;Iâ€™m not a believer in Intelligent Design, Creationism, Darwinism, free will, non-monetary compensation, or anything else I canâ€™t eat if I try hard enough&rdquo;), he decided instead to discuss the discussion.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&rsquo;t meta enough, he focused on how both sides of the debate mischaracterize the other side&rsquo;s arguments.  As I was reading it, I thought &ldquo;man, he&rsquo;s not doing a very good job here; I&rsquo;ve never heard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of these points that he&rsquo;s complaining about.&rdquo;  And then I realized that was the whole point.  He was either using his own misrepresentation as a meta-joke, or he was just interested in stirring up trouble.  Or probably both.</p>
<p>He then got 300 angry comments from both sides.</p>
<p>Today, Scott <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posted a follow-up<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He essentially verified my theory, but apparently he had taken it a step further.  &ldquo;I was waiting to see how many people fell into the irony trap and misrepresented my blog entry and then attacked it.&rdquo;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(The answer is &ldquo;a lot&rdquo;.)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  He links to one blog post in particular, but the page is currently down.  He reiterates his point, and at the end leaves the whole thing open for more recursive <!-- raw HTML omitted -->straw men<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I applaud his willingness to be stung by hornets just for the sake of a joke.  But what&rsquo;s more amazing is that, in the end, his joke was proven <!-- raw HTML omitted -->correct<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by those who were trying to refute it.  It&rsquo;s also more than a little disturbing.  Can&rsquo;t we engage in intelligent dialogue anymore?</p>

			 <p>The webcomic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Goats<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is probably the second one I ever read on a regular basis (the first being the obvious and now-unreadable User Friendly).  At some point, I lost my interest in Goats and it fell off my list.  This was probably back when I used bookmarks instead of an RSS reader to read news and comics, and it was cumbersome to check more than a half-dozen a day.  I re-found Goats recently, and started reading it from the present.  I was intimidated by the huge archive, and was a little lost in the current story, but I remembered — vaguely — who most of the core cast was.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Jon Rosenberg <!-- raw HTML omitted -->discussed the current story<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and alluded to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->series reboot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> three years ago that I was able to start from a point in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->middle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and get all the back stories.  Now that I&rsquo;m caught up, this comic strip is suddenly one of my favorites.  It&rsquo;s definitely plot-driven, like Sluggy Freelance, but less epic (so it&rsquo;s easier to follow day-by-day) and far more surreal.</p>
<p>Give it a try.</p>

			 <p>Am I the only one who doesn&rsquo;t like keyboard shortcuts on websites?  I find it far easier to navigate on the web by, I don&rsquo;t know, clicking on things, than by remembering that &ldquo;Y&rdquo; means to archive, and shift-A means to reply-to-all-in-new-window.  One of the things that stood in the back of my mind as not-too-nice about Google Reader was the fact that it forced these keyboard shortcuts upon you.  Gmail is at least nice enough to default to shortcuts off.</p>
<p>And now Bloglines, thinking it needs to actually start (gasp) improving, took a look at Google Reader to see what they needed to do.  Obviously, there was only one thing there they could learn from.  Keyboard shortcuts!  Don&rsquo;t hit shift-A in Bloglines or you&rsquo;ll end up marking all of your news items read.  The &ldquo;read all&rdquo; feature itself is so ridiculous that even before they started &ldquo;innovating&rdquo;, I had wished I could remove the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->link<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that did that.  It&rsquo;s obnoxious — I end up with a page that&rsquo;s several megabytes long.  It&rsquo;s dangerous — the only way I can undo it is by clicking &ldquo;Mark all new&rdquo; on every single feed&rsquo;s header.  And it&rsquo;s totally unnecessary.</p>

I keep having to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;m not used to doing that with a Google product.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s a solid feed reader, but the navigation isn&rsquo;t quite intuitive.  &ldquo;Down&rdquo; should be at the bottom.  There should be a way to scroll through the new posts without viewing them (or having to mark those you viewed as &ldquo;keep unread&rdquo;, which, by the way, is really far away).  But one of the things I&rsquo;d really like, in contrast to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloglines<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is the ability to see which feeds have new items at a glance (and sort by that criterion).  In the &ldquo;My subscriptions&rdquo; view in Google Reader, I can&rsquo;t tell what has new items nor can I even resort them as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I have high hopes and I plan to keep coming back to it — it is the big G, after all, and they have a track record of improving services in response to user feedback — but I&rsquo;m going to stick with Bloglines for now.</p>

			 <p>Even apart from the particularly catastrophic devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, this has been an extremely active Atlantic hurricane season.

After a remarkably busy spring and the most active July on record, the forecasts had been increased to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->20<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

Katrina was the fourth-strongest hurricane ever measured.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ever.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  And thanks to its surgical strike on New Orleans, it already stands as the second most deadly Atlantic hurricane.</p>
<p>There have been fifteen named storms so far this season.  The season officially lasts for 11 more weeks, and there are only six names left (Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince, and Wilma).  After that, hurricanes will be named for letters of the Greek alphabet for the first time since they&rsquo;ve had names.</p>

			 <p>Have you ever wondered why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->grain alcohol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like Everclear or Graves are only 95% ethanol (190 proof)?  I have.  I assumed it was an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ROI<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thing.  My theory figured the increased cost to distill the alcohol to such a purity would force up the price, which customers would not bear.  Apparently, there&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->different reason<!-- raw HTML omitted --> altogether, and it&rsquo;s a chemistry thing.</p>
<p>The yeast that creates alcohol dies at around 14% concentration.  This is why beers and wines are rarely found even above 18- or 20-proof.  In order to make stronger drinks, the water-alcohol mixture is distilled, which is really just another word for evaporating them.  Alcohol boils at a far lower temperature than water, so if you collect the vapor and recondense it, you end up with a lot more alcohol than water.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happens as water is left behind.  The more alcohol there is in the solution, the higher its boiling point (and the lower of that of the water).  Somewhere around 95% or 96% alcohol, they converge, and the two liquids boil at the same time (at only 173°F).  Simple distillation will not allow you to do any better.</p>
<p>So what if you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->need<!-- raw HTML omitted --> absolutely pure alcohol?  There is an option.  You can add benzene to the mixture.  This changes the behavior of the solution, and allows the alcohol to boil away again.  Unfortunately, benzene is terribly harmful, even in extremely tiny amounts.  Bone marrow damage, a weakened immune system, severe liver disease, and a highly increased chance of cancer are some of the fates that would await you if you were unsatisfied with 190-proof grain alcohol.</p>

			 <p>Recently I finished reading <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Time Traveler&rsquo;s Wife<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Audrey Niffenegger.  I had been reluctant to pick it up.  The cover and the summary on the back gave me this dizzy &ldquo;romance novel&rdquo; feeling, but my father-in-law recommended it.  Finally, when I hit a thin area in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my reading list<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and M essentially forced me to read the first chapter), I decided to give it a chance.  Five pages later, I was completely and irreversibly hooked.  That statement is <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NOT<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The story starts quickly, and the first couple of chapters give you the goose-bumpy willies when some weird stuff happens.  The characters are totally believable even if their situation is (literally) incredible.  The book started off very engrossing, and as it got more serious and intense, I couldn&rsquo;t stop reading.  I averaged more than 100 pages a day for a week, the first time I&rsquo;ve done that with a book in a long time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my suggestion: go to the library or the book store.  Read the first five pages.  The book will either purchase itself, or you will put it back.  Oh, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do any research into movie deals until you&rsquo;ve finished the book, or you&rsquo;ll be sorry.</p>

The Left has only a certain amount of power in the current administration, but if Roberts was denied or filibustered, could a different nominee really be any better?

			 <p>Today, I gave an intro to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wiki<!-- raw HTML omitted --> class at work.  Ever since I moved the Unix group&rsquo;s home page from a wad of hand-edited HTML files to wiki, it&rsquo;s been a far bigger hit than I expected.  There are now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> teams using wikis for their documentation or interested in migrating, and I expect there are probably a few more that will be converting soon.  It&rsquo;s great to be able to feel that I&rsquo;m making a bottom-up difference at work, and that open source (not to mention <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is touching a few more people who might not otherwise ever feel it.</p>

			 <p>Nomad refuses to carry coinage.  I recall one time (likely apocryphal) he purchased a soda for $1.25 at a train station, and then put his change (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->all seventy-five cents<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) on top of a garbage can and left it.  I can&rsquo;t remember if I did the sterotypical thing and picked it up, but I&rsquo;m sure I called it foolish.</p>
<p>But it got me thinking; is carrying change a waste of energy?  If you carried a pocket-full of coins all day, could you purchase more calories of food than you burned carrying it?  I thought about it for a while, and I couldn&rsquo;t reason it out, so I decided to calculate it.  The answer somewhat surprised me.</p>
<p>Coins are quite light.  The U.S. Mint <!-- raw HTML omitted -->says that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a penny weighs 2.5 grams, a nickel 5g, a dime 2.268g, and a quarter 5.67g.  Figuring out how much walking &ldquo;all day&rdquo; is was difficult.  I got numbers (for an average American adult) that varied from a quarter-mile to five miles.  I decided to go with a middle-ground number, 2.7 miles.  Looking at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some numbers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for calorie consumption during walking, I estimated that a person burns one calorie per pound of weight per hour of walking at 2mph.  Once I had all of my data, the calculations were pretty easy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Essentially what that means is that if you carried a whole dollar of pennies around for a day, you would burn almost three-quarters of an additional calorie.  Even the least calorie-dense foods (like, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pepsi One<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) are enough to make it worth it, and some of the most calorie-dense foods (like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Big Mac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) provide you with several hundred calories per dollar.</p>
<p>(Pennies require the most energy-per-dollar to carry.  A nickel would cost 0.297 calories per dollar, and dimes and quarters both run a measly 0.068.)</p>

			 <p>So here&rsquo;s the situation as it stands now.  We know for a fact that there will be backwards-compatibility of some sort built into Nintendo&rsquo;s Revolution console.  We know (or at least are fairly sure) that online access will be free of charge.  Unfortunately, we also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thought<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that a huge number of first-party games would be free.  We were amazed and incredulous, since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that list<!-- raw HTML omitted --> included every Mario, Zelda, and Donkey Kong game ever made, as well as a number of other ground-breaking and phenomenal games like Gyromite and Goldeneye.</p>
<p>Sadly, it sounds like that&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not entirely true<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Some games will be available for free to owners of certain other games, but let&rsquo;s hope that Nintendo doesn&rsquo;t go too far in the wrong direction with this.  If Mario 128 (ooh, Brian&rsquo;s gonna squirm about that) comes with every back Nintendo game, they&rsquo;ll sell.. er.. okay, they won&rsquo;t sell any more additional games.  But they&rsquo;ll get lots of love from the Nintendo community, instead of pushing away <!-- raw HTML omitted -->those of us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who liked everything we saw about the Xbox 360.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s a little-known fact that with a library card in the state of Connecticut, you can take out books from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any<!-- raw HTML omitted --> public library in the state.  You also don&rsquo;t even need to go to a library other than your local one to do it, and even then you don&rsquo;t have to go until your book is in.

Click the &ldquo;Request Item&rdquo; button to the right of your result and put in your library card bar code number.</p>
<p>It generally takes less than a week for your local library to get the book.

<p>I have about 250 photos from the six years of NVAD.  I&rsquo;ve decided to post a few of my favorites online.  It&rsquo;s clear that we were all very bad photographers, because even my favorites aren&rsquo;t that great.</p>

		<a href="https://plutor.org/2005/05/05/cisco-ip-phone.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2005-05-05 14:33:38 -0500">May 5, 2005</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday, I was surfing through the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;24&rdquo; tag on del.icio.us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when I found a site that had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the ring that CTU uses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in several formats.  After I remembered that I have the exact <!-- raw HTML omitted -->same phone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at work, I decided to see if I could get this ring on my desk phone.</p>
<p>The first step was to figure out if this was even possible.  There are a number of rings already on the phones at work, and they&rsquo;re apparently fairly programmable, so I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when a couple quick searches led me to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a document<!-- raw HTML omitted --> explaining how to make custom rings for the Cisco IP phone model 7960.  The file format requirements at the bottom were a little challenging, though.  I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do about &ldquo;uLaw compression&rdquo; or &ldquo;Raw PCM&rdquo;, But I figured it probably wasn&rsquo;t going to be extremely hard.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, I had two free applications: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wavetools<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &ldquo;a library consisting of 8 programs for manipulating mono WAV files&rdquo; that let me resample the file to 8000 Hz and cut it to 16080 samples (the maximum length), and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AFsp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which then converted it to a raw PCM.  When all was said and done, I had my ringtone in the right format.  I only hoped that it still sounded right.</p>
<p>The next step was less technological and more political, and I wasn&rsquo;t kidding myself into thinking it would be easy.  The Cisco IP phones use a centralized server to get their configuration information, firmware, and (apparently) ringtones.  I sent an email to Paul the phone guy, asking him if it would be a big deal.  As I expected, he referred me to a middle-manager, but luckily I knew him pretty well.  I asked him if it would be possible, and at first he seemed receptive, but he started to realize that it might be setting a bad precedent. I could only imagine how many people would want to have their own ringtones on there, and chances are they wouldn&rsquo;t have the skills to convert it to the exactly right format.</p>
<p>I was concerned that this was the end of my 24 ringtone story.  I emailed the PCM and the link to the author of the original page, telling him that it was untested but that I was confident it was right.  Then I went home.</p>
<p>The next morning, in the shower (as if you doubted it), I realized: the phones just use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->TFTP<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get all of the stuff from the server.  TFTP servers are, well, trivial to set up.  In fact, I know of at least one of our servers at work that&rsquo;s currently running a TFTP daemon.  The hard part was telling the phone to use a TFTP server other than the one that it was told to use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, it was just a matter of figuring out what files I needed to get from the old TFTP server.  I started my new server with verbosity turned way up, and rebooted the phone (well, I unplugged it and plugged it back in).  When the phone requested files, I saw them in the log.  I then used a TFTP client program to download them from the old server.  I modified the RingList.xml and added my raw PCM to the directory, and rebooted my phone again.</p>
<p>When it came up, the ring was on the phone and looked and sounded just like any other ring.</p>

			 <p>I saw Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy last night.  It&rsquo;s the first movie since Lord of the Rings I cared enough about to see on opening night.  Here&rsquo;s my very short spoiler-free review: Despite a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->poor review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Douglas Adams' biographer, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mixed reviews<!-- raw HTML omitted --> overall, it was much farther from terrible than it was from fantastic.  It was more silly than wry, but it was surprisingly faithful to the book.  And despite a number of departures from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->canon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> storyline, all of the changes still felt Adamsesque.  I was definitely happy with the movie.</p>

			 <p>What&rsquo;s the attraction behind printing things out?  The new guy at work has printed at least a dozen emails this week, and also printed several of the documentation pages out and posted them in his cube.  When I&rsquo;m showing him something, I&rsquo;m sure to say &ldquo;This has a Wiki page.  You can just copy and paste these commands I&rsquo;m running, just like I&rsquo;m doing right now.&rdquo;  But he has to write down every command I run on a big ol' pad of paper.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to stay virtually paperless.  I take notes on my PDA instead of dead trees.  I do have a notebook handy in case I need to do something that requires it, like diagramming an application or environment, but I rarely have to use it.  I kinda feel like the wasteful habits of my co-worker are invalidating my good intentions.  Looking around me in the last week, I&rsquo;ve seen a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of desks covered in stacks of papers, and I&rsquo;m finally realizing how common this is.  Why do so many people need paper copies of everything, when they just end up being unused clutter?</p>

			 <p>Had a little time this weekend to do some HTML hacking, so I got rid of the much-derided orange header.  Mount Everest forever!  I think I might come up with some way to rotate the header image, too, but then again it might stagnate like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Metablog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Reply if you see any funkiness with the new header.</p>

			 <p>Just to allay any fears, I have not forgotten this blog.  There&rsquo;s a huge new site launch next week for which I&rsquo;m in the middle of configuring and tweaking 50 Linux servers.  I&rsquo;ve heard some people say that this is our single biggest launch since the dot-com bubble burst.  I can believe it.</p>
<p>I was called for Jury duty (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->petit jury<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, thank goodness) on May 3.  As a heavy-duty Law and Order fan, I look forward to watching the real thing from the inside.  Believe it or not, I actually hope I&rsquo;ll get picked.  I just hope it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with E3.</p>

			 <p>I was reading through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this AskMe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today, and it started me thinking.  Emailing yourself five or ten years in the future isn&rsquo;t a difficult problem (in fact, that thread includes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->several<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->solutions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  But what would be the most reliable way to get a message to yourself in, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->50 years<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?  Not necessarily an email, and inexpensiveness and plausibility are important (becoming President and renaming the country &ldquo;Hello Future Me&rdquo; won&rsquo;t work).</p>
<p>Would Doc Brown&rsquo;s method of sending a letter from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1888<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 1885 to Marty standing in the road (not even an address) in 1955 even work back then?  I doubt it.  How could it be done today?</p>

			 <p>The day before New Years, I went to MoMA in New York with the inlaws.  We had reservations for dinner, but we were a little bit early and were sick of walking, so we stopped at a random (extremely nice, mid-high-range) restaurant and sat down in their quiet bar for a pre-dinner drink.  We were chatting casually, and Mrs. D asked me &ldquo;what are the big games now?&rdquo;  I told her that this was a huge season for sequels: Half-Life 2, GTA: San Andreas, and Halo 2, in particular.  The very curteous bartender, a man with a thick french accent, stopped what he was doing, bent over towards us, and asked &ldquo;Excuse me, but did you say you play Halo?  I love that game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never played the game, but it obviously has had a huge impact on people who otherwise might not consider themselves gamers.  I cant figure out how to segue from that story to a link about an international <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Halo superstar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but let&rsquo;s pretend I did it smoothly.</p>

			 <p>There are a lot of questions about this, but very few adequate answers available on Google.  Solaris has a feature called &ldquo;lofs&rdquo; that allows you to mount some directory (say /bigvolume/foo) somewhere else (say /bar).  The quick response is &ldquo;duh, symlinks&rdquo;, but if you want /bar to be read-only, or noexec, or nosuid, or some other uber-secure setting, this allows you to do it.  Also, since chroot() breaks symlinks that point outside the new root, this can be used to simplify setting up chroot jails.</p>
<p>Since kernel 2.4, Linux has had support for mount binds (synonymous to Solaris' lofs), and here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>
<p>Command to mount /bigvolume/foo under bar:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --># mount &ndash;bind /bigvolume/foo /bar<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If there are other filesystems mounted under /bigvolume/foo, they&rsquo;ll be ignored.  To get them bound also, you&rsquo;ll need to use &ndash;rbind instead of &ndash;bind.  You can add -o and any options (like noexec, etc.) to the command.</p>
<p>To make this bind occur automagically on reboot, add the following to /etc/fstab:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/bigvolume/foo    /bar     none    bind    0 0<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Add any options after &ldquo;bind&rdquo; and a comma as you would normally.</p>

			 <p>Remember the 2000 election (sure you do), when Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote?  Well, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->happened<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->before<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it&rsquo;s one of the strongest arguments that people use for abolishing the electoral college (an argument that I haven&rsquo;t chosen a side on, to be honest).  It got me thinking: how much could a candidate lose the popular vote by and still win the electoral vote?  The candidate would have to get half (plus one) of the votes in &ldquo;strong states&rdquo;, and zero votes in &ldquo;weak states&rdquo;.  In this case, a state&rsquo;s strength is defined as electoral votes per voter.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A candidate could win the election with only 21.7% of the national popular vote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by just squeaking by in AK, AL, AR, AZ, CO, CT, DC, DE, GA, HI, IA, ID, IN, KS, KY, LA, MD, ME, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NM, NV, NY, OK, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WV, and WY and getting no votes in any other states.  You&rsquo;ll note that CT, MD, and VA are &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; states than California, but since it has such a large population, including it instead of the three weaker states increases the final total quite a bit.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note that I had to ignore Maine and Nebraska&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->congressional district method<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since it would add too many extra variables.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Despite the reaction this will provoke from Chris, I will take this opportunity to go off on a tangent on Sir Arthur (probably best known for writing the 2001/2010/2061/3001: A Space Odyssey series).  Although I love that short story, and 2001 was pure genious (more elaborate than the movie, and really shines a bright searchlight on Kubrick&rsquo;s obfuscations), most of his other stuff that I&rsquo;ve read was really dismal.

			 <p>Boggle is arguably one of the best candidates for a simple online multiplayer game.  All of the interaction between players is at a single moment, and the scoring can be easily automated.  JavaScript with DOM allows you to do a lot of really neat things, so as a test of my skills, I decided to try to make a massively multiplayer online Boggle game.  It worked, but my backend code was pretty inefficient.  When I brought it down, Evan offered to mirror it.  He&rsquo;s not only done that, but he&rsquo;s improved the game beyond even my plans.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Check out the game<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Around the the end of January, I was doing some reading for work on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Document Object Model<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (DOM).  The DOM (ideally) allows JavaScript to access and modify any element in an HTML document in a heirarchical Object-Oriented fashion (well, as OO as Javascript can ever be).  The more I read about what was possible, the more I realized that I could create a totally interactive application written in merely HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Then I remembered what I think is the most useful JavaScript feature in existance: asyncronous HTTP requests using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XMLHTTP object<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for Internet Explorer or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XMLHttpRequest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> object in Mozilla-based browsers.  Using this object and a little server-side scripting, I could not only keep important logic and large files like dictionaries on the server, but I could also create multiplayer (potentially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->massively<!-- raw HTML omitted --> multiplayer) interactive online games that required nothing but a modern browser.</p>
<p>Think about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PopCap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pogo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yahoo Games<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MSN Games<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Every single one of the games on these sites could be done without requiring a single plugin.  I thought about it, and I decided to set about demonstrating it.  (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was only after this game was mostly completed that I noticed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SSCrabble<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  While it uses similar client-side scripting techniques, it lacks the multiplayer functionality entirely, which is too bad.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>WEBoggle is primarily HTML and JavaScript.  There&rsquo;s fewer than 100 server-side lines of Perl, and a 90,000 word dictionary.</p>
<p>All WEBoggle requires is either Internet Explorer 5 or newer, or a Mozilla-based browser like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mozilla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firebird<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Galeon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Internet Explorer 4 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should<!-- raw HTML omitted --> work, but I&rsquo;ve never tried it.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  There are a few caveats, and good reasons why other common browsers like Opera do not work, but those are all listed in the Bugs section below.  Also, your browser must accept cookies.  Sorry.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Cheating in an online game is an inherent problem.  I&rsquo;ve worked as hard as I could in order to keep important scoring logic server-side in WEBoggle.  I&rsquo;m only human, and it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ve missed something and it&rsquo;s possible to modify the JavaScript source code so that it submits invalid words and they get erroneously scored.</p>
<p>A much easier way to cheat, however, is to write a script to give you all of the words that can be found on the board.  I could have made it more difficult to do this, but as long as the letters are legible to the player, you could simply type them into a command line script that would then give you a list of words to type back into the game.  There was simply no way to prevent this. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wrote such a script in about 60 seconds, so if you&rsquo;re considering it, your effort won&rsquo;t make you &ldquo;the first&rdquo;.  I was able to get more than 50 points consistantly.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>
<p>I just hope that everyone who plays this game remembers that cheating is no fun, not for you, and not for anyone with whom you&rsquo;re playing..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once WEBoggle started generating several thousand player-games per day, it started interfering with the operation of the sites on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my webhost<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I took it down until I could make it more efficient, and a guy named Evan Simpson came forward with an offer to mirror it for the time being.</p>
<p>As anyone who&rsquo;s seen my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Projects listing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will agree, I have a short attention span.  Updating WEBoggle kind of fell off my radar, and I told Evan that he was in charge.  He&rsquo;s done far more than I ever planned or expected: &ldquo;missing words&rdquo; submissions, two simultaneous games (one of which is Big Boggle), the ability to rotate the board, and a list of &ldquo;words that nobody found&rdquo; with each round.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank everyone who helped me test WEBoggle and suggested stupid improvements: BrainiACK, Nomad, Splatta, Kazy, and especially M.  Also, all the people who donated money through Paypal and posted links to WEBoggle on their blogs.  At its height, more than 6000 person-games were being played every day.  And a thousand thanks to Evan Simpson for mirroring and then improving the game.</p>

I was an active part of the community for a couple years, running a server, working on some applications, helping with testing alpha versions, etc.  Eventually, I became a full-fledged member of the development team, helping PapasNewBag out with the coding for the mod.  Many of the visual enhancements included in version 1.0 were my contributions.</p>
<p>Working on S&amp;I was a fantastic experience that I will treasure forever. &lt;/corny&gt;  Honestly, the entire team is friendly and brilliant, and their hard work is evident in the quality of the maps, models, and replayability of Science and Industry.</p>
<p>Here are some of the behind-the-scenes screenshots I took and sent to the other dev team members, showing what I was working on and what problems I was having.  These images were all taken between January and April 2002.  Also included is my history of S&amp;I — <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Mod&rsquo;s Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> — written February 2002.</p>

Upgrading was always a challenge, and the complexity of the boot scripts made things really confusing.  Based on a BSD-like &ldquo;ports&rdquo; system, Crux is a built-from-source Linux in the tradition of Gentoo.  But it&rsquo;s far simpler, and for the first time I really feel like I understand how Linux works, from one end to the other.  There&rsquo;s only very weak dependency support (an advantage, in my mind, over having to run <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rpm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;nodeps<!-- raw HTML omitted --> three-quarters of the time), and it&rsquo;s not for newbies (you need to partition your disk by hand, and compile your own kernel), but I&rsquo;m in love.

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update, 08-13:  Holy hell.

			 <p>Watching Season 3 of our Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Ghetto Box Set, I came across the episode <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Family Business<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It&rsquo;s not an extremely notable episode (besides the old-Ferrengi-lady nudity), but it sticks out prominently in my mind (and not because of the nudity).  It&rsquo;s the first time we meet freighter captain Kasidy Yates.  I had known that Penny Johnson was in the series eventually, and I was dreading it.  I could never trust <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sherry Palmer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Never!  The episode was over before I realized how great of an actress she really is.

			 <p>A few months ago, I was asked to make an inventory application for Priceline.  I thought it would be simple.  But you try making an inventory system for three different IT groups.  Make it so that the networking devices and servers are logically &ldquo;connected&rdquo; properly, so you can search - for example - for all machines connected to a given core switch.  What about tracking depreciation, and controlling who can edit what?  Then write scripts that make sure that the information you can get from the Cisco switches matches with what&rsquo;s in the database.</p>

			 <p>This morning on my way to work, I spent some time behind a police truck.  This particular truck was towing one of those automated &ldquo;You are going this fast&rdquo; machines, probably to some far-away location.  I wished it had been on.  Would it show negative speeds?  Could I get my speed within 1 mph of the speed of the truck?</p>

In human interaction, for example.  Eyeballs (and photons) make up the physical layer.  The part of your brain that interprets the images into faces and bodies constitute the datalink layer.  The portion of the brain that then identifies people and matches names to them (sometimes inaccurately) is the network layer.  This analogy continues with the session layer &ndash; holding a conversation &ndash; and even all the way to the application layer &ndash; where you can have a long-term relationship with other individuals over many conversations and meetings.</p>
<p>I skipped some layers because the metaphor isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s pretty close.</p>

How often will an employer ask you to sit in a crowded room with 50 of your peers and sit and silently take a written exam in order to solve some business or technical or ethical problem?  Is test taking even marginally related to the real world?  Teachers should spend less time giving tests designed to stroke both their own egos and those of the administration, and more time assigning projects which require creative thinking and demonstrate the application of in-class concepts to real-world problems.

			 <p>The one and only release of my Science and Industry inspired web-based text adventure.  Note that there are lots of features missing.  It should be considered an alpha-quality product.</p>

			 <p>I changed the site design since my last &ldquo;update&rdquo;.  Added (and now removed, because of crappy drivers) my webcam.  Added my S&amp;I text adventure to the projects page.  More to come, when I&rsquo;m not bogged down by schoolwork.</p>

			 <p>This is really how I broke into the S&amp;I community.  I wrote a statistics script to parse through my server&rsquo;s logs, and all of a sudden I was everyone&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>The next version (Beta 4) was in planning for a while.  I was planning on changing for Perl to C++ (which would hopefully result in speed improvements), and completely rewriting 99% of the parsing code.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The current release (Beta 3.11) became broken with S&amp;I 0.97a, and over the years I&rsquo;ve decided that individual player stats put too much pressure on the individual to do well, no matter what it does to the team.  This wasn&rsquo;t my desired effect, but it has led me to shutting down this project.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->THE FILES BELOW ARE UNSUPPORTED AND NON-FUNCTIONING WITH S&amp;I 0.97a AND NEWER.  They are provided only for posterity&rsquo;s sake.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
