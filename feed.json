I ended up deciding on a 43-inch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sony X830C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Great viewing angle and plenty of HDMI. Rtings felt the contrast wasn&rsquo;t great and the surface was too reflective, but 4k.com didn&rsquo;t really agree and general picture quality wasn&rsquo;t super high on our list &ndash; I was sure it would be better than our old free screen.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it&rsquo;s on the wall now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Six inches larger than the old screen, but covers up less wall. Definitely good. More detailed thoughts coming after I get more time to watch it.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->UPDATE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: After using the TV for the past two months, I&rsquo;m definitely a fan. The reflectivity is not a problem, and the colors and viewing angle are excellent. We almost never use our Roku box anymore, which isn&rsquo;t its fault, it&rsquo;s just that our TV does everything we used it for. Android TV is pretty good, I think our TV has only crash-rebooted a couple of times (which is a weird concept). The UI could be a bit faster, but whatever. It&rsquo;s nice having the Guide be accurate even though we only use an antenna (however our old TV used to get its guide had stopped working years ago).

I spent lots of time reading <a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-500-tv/\">Wirecutter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/40-42-43-inch/best\">Rtings</a>, and <a href=\"http://4k.com/tv/\">4k.com</a>.\n\nThe Wirecutter recommended TV (Vizio M43-C1) was very very close to what I needed, but it didn't have a great viewing angle. I ended up deciding on a 43-inch <a href=\"http://www.sony.com/electronics/televisions/xbr-x830c-series\">Sony X830C</a>. Great viewing angle and plenty of HDMI. Rtings felt the contrast wasn't great and the surface was too reflective, but 4k.com didn't really agree and general picture quality wasn't super high on our list -- I was sure it would be better than our old free screen.\n\nAnyhow, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/photos/R9MEqLo3A8XGyM2X9\">it's on the wall now</a>. Six inches larger than the old screen, but covers up less wall. Definitely good. More detailed thoughts coming after I get more time to watch it.\n\n<strong>UPDATE</strong>: After using the TV for the past two months, I'm definitely a fan. The reflectivity is not a problem, and the colors and viewing angle are excellent. We almost never use our Roku box anymore, which isn't its fault, it's just that our TV does everything we used it for. Android TV is pretty good, I think our TV has only crash-rebooted a couple of times (which is a weird concept). The UI could be a bit faster, but whatever. It's nice having the Guide be accurate even though we only use an antenna (however our old TV used to get its guide had stopped working years ago). The biggest complaint I have is that the remote is sort of a disaster.\n",

				"content_text": "Ever since my parents have been living within spitting distance of Fort Myers, I've sent them a quick list of Red Sox storylines going into Spring Training. Seeing as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RedSox/status/700345446779260930\">pitchers and catchers report today</a>, I figured today would be a good day to do it. 2016 is going to be an important year for the Red Sox.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There's a good chance that manager <strong>John Farrell</strong> is on a relatively short leash. His World Series victory in 2013 has given him a little benefit of the doubt, but the last two seasons have seen last-place finishes and declining attendance. General Manager Ben Cherington was replaced with his assistant Mike Hazen, so it's clear that <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/just-a-bit-outside/story/boston-red-sox-hire-dave-dombrowski-president-ben-cherington-gone-right-move-blood-sport-081815\">ownership is willing to make changes</a>. I'd bet if we finish in last place again, Farrell would be gone.</li>\n\t<li>We've got lots and lots of young talent, mostly promoted up through the farm system. <strong>Mookie Betts</strong> (RF) is probably the most prominent, but Jackie Bradley Jr (CF), Xander Bogaerts (SS), Rusney Castillo (LF), and Blake Swihart (C) are all promising kids, too.</li>\n\t<li>We signed the premiere pitching free agent in December: <strong>David Price</strong>. He's making $30 million this year, and then also for the 6 years following that. He won the Cy Young in 2012 and was 2nd in voting and led the AL in ERA last year. He won 18+ games three of his last five seasons and we haven't had an 18-game winner since Lester in 2010.</li>\n\t<li>We also picked up a big name closer: <strong>Craig Kimbrel</strong>. Led the league in saves for 4 years (4th place last year). Both he and Price are solidly in their prime, too: 28 and 30, respectively.</li>\n\t<li>As for last year's big signings that didn't perform as expected, well, we'll see how they go. There were rumors of trade attempts for <strong>Pablo Sandoval</strong> ($17M/y) and <strong>Hanley Ramirez</strong> ($22M/y), but nothing panned out. Ramirez was moved from his usual shortstop (where we're overloaded) to left field last year (where he looked lost at Fenway, especially compared to the young guys) and this year will be at First Base, <a href=\"http://nesn.com/2015/10/red-sox-first-base-offseason-outlook-can-hanley-ramirez-handle-new-job/\">where he's never played</a>.</li>\n\t<li>The rest of our starting rotation is pretty stable from last year, which is to say: mediocre. <strong>Buchholz</strong> will look amazing through June like usual, but then will go to 15-day DL and stretch that out to missing a dozen starts. (We exercised his option for this year, and we've got another one for next year, but I wonder if we let him go if he can't stay healthy. Again.) <strong>Porcello</strong> will hopefully live up to his 4-year $20M+/y extension. E-Rod, Kelly, and Wright will probably get through the year with 4ish ERAs and we'll have to hope that's good enough to keep us in games.</li>\n\t<li>And last, but definitely not least: this will be <strong>Big Papi</strong>'s last season. By most advanced metrics (WAR, OPS+, RE24), he was among the top hitters on our team yet again last year and hopefully he'll go out on top too.</li>\n</ul>\n\nMost statistical projections have us <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2016/02/15/mlb-2016-win-totals/80389576/\">favored to win</a> <a href=\"http://www.fangraphs.com/depthcharts.aspx?position=Standings\">the division</a> or be <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25485322/the-pecota-mlb-winloss-projections-are-out-so-lets-compare\">in the running for a wildcard</a>, both of which depend on some luck and few injuries. Hopefully it'll be an exciting year.\n\nGo Sox!\n",

It is also related to \"can\" (in the sense of being able to do something) and \"could\" and \"cunning\".</li>\n\t<li>(un)kempt - Kempt is certainly less common, but it's <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=unkempt%2Ckempt&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t4%3B%2Cunkempt%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bunkempt%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BUnkempt%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Ckempt%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3BKempt%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bkempt%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BKEMPT%3B%2Cc0\">far from dead</a>.</li>\n\t<li>(im)pecunious - Direct from the Latin. The root word <i>pecunia</i> is also the source of the English \"pecuniary\".</li>\n\t<li>(in)ane - The first one that was a Latin adjective in its own right, not a negation.</li>\n\t<li>(in)trudes - From the Latin <i>trudere</i> (to push). In this case, the in- prefix doesn't mean the opposite, but rather \"into\" (therefore: extrudes).</li>\n \t<li>(de)ceptive - The Latin root <i>capere</i> (to take) took a slightly more roundabout route to \"capable\".</li>\n\t<li>(in)sipid - Related, somewhat, to the word \"sapient\", via the Latin root <i>sapidus</i>/<i>sapere</i>.</li>\n\t<li>(dis)traught - Distraught comes from the word \"distract\", perhaps modified like the past participles \"caught\" and \"bought\".</li>\n\t<li>(in)sist - From the Latin root <i>sistere</i> (take a stand). Like intrude, the prefix means in/on, although the reverse never made it to English. Related to assist.</li>\n\t<li>(non)chalantly - From the French <i>non-</i> and <i>chaloir</i> (have concern for)</li>\n\t<li>(un)gainly - From the Old Norse <i>un-</i> and <i>gegn</i> (convenient or direct). Related to \"again\" and \"against\".</li>\n\t<li>(in)digent - The prefix here isn't in-, but rather Latin <i>indu</i> and <i>egere</i> (need, want)</li>\n\t<li>(as)sertive - \"Assert\" is from the Latin <i>asserere</i> (to claim). (Aside: either this is out of place, or I'm misinterpreting which word the author was using. I see no way to interpret \"as-\" as a prefix)</li>\n\t<li>(in)choate - The last two are the most interesting. This word used to have a more straightforward and less judgemental meaning. From the Latin <i>in-</i> (meaning on) and, strangely, <i>cohum</i> (the strap fastened to an ox).</li>\n\t<li>(a)loof - The prefix \"a-\" is similar to the same prefix in anew or afoot, and the Middle English <i>loof</i> is from the Dutch <i>loef</i> (the weather side of a ship).</li>\n</ul>\n\nFinal count: 11 negations, 5 prefixes with non-negation meanings, and 3 words not constructed with a prefix.\n",

Harpoon Brewery started canning <a href=\"http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/harpoon-to-can-their-beer/\">some summer beers</a> a couple of years ago, but now they are spending more than a million dollars to <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2012/04/18/local_craft_brewers_start_canning_their_beers/\">add canning machinery</a> to their main brewery in Boston.\n\nCanned beer at a ballpark, however, is a good idea in almost every single sense I can think of:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Since the beers don't have to be poured, there's no spillage and no foam to pour off, which means essentially zero waste.</li>\n\t<li>They get cold faster than bottles.</li>\n\t<li>The non-beer weight of these cans is far less than that of kegs and carbonation systems, which means less wasted delivery cost.</li>\n\t<li>Lines will be shorter since all the person behind the counter has to do is pull a can out of the fridge and open it (and they did tests -- opened cans don't fly as far as opened plastic bottles). They'll also be shorter since the cans are bigger than cups -- people won't head back for more as often.</li>\n\t<li>Aluminum is just about the most efficient thing to recycle: only about <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/9302727?story_id=9302727\">5% of the energy</a> required for non-recycled aluminum</li>\n\t<li>You don't have to potentially toss any extra (like you have to do with kegs). This means that the park could carry a wider variety of beers and not have to worry about what to do with the unsold cans of the less popular brands.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAnd there's just something about drinking a cold beer out of a can that says \"summer\" more than a bottle or a cup.\n\nHere's a list of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahd1JYZMLVnHdDl5bVFsdjJoMzBCTWFydGRvcWJFdVE#gid=0\">what beer is available where in the park</a>. Most everywhere has cans of Stella Artois and Yuengling, two very good lagers. I'm not sure if the Oskar Blues and Sierra Nevada brands are in the tallboys or if they're only available in normal 12-ounce cans. I will investigate when I'm at the game against the Red Sox this coming Saturday, and report back.\n\n<strong>Update, 21 May:</strong> The 24-ounce cans are pretty much only available in Yuengling Lager, and we only found them on the lower level. Most of the other types of beer are in more-typical 16-ounce cans (500mL in the case of Stella Artois). Still: great selection, decent price, all the above points about convenience still stand.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Last April, to no one in particular, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->asked the following question<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It became clear, after a brief discussion with some friends, that the shortest possible trip is somewhere on the order of a hundred miles. Citi Field in the Bronx and Yankee Stadium in Queens are only 6 miles apart. Since the Mets and the Yankees are in different leagues and each team <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plays one series at home<!-- raw HTML omitted --> against every other team in its own league, you could just spend the whole season going back and forth between the two stadiums. (In fact, I&rsquo;d be surprised if at least one New Yorker baseball fan with time and money to burn hadn&rsquo;t done exactly this.)</p>\n<p>In order to avoid this &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; solution, a modification to the puzzle would have to be introduced. After throwing around a bunch of attempts, I hit upon the perfect goal: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15 games, 15 stadiums, 30 teams<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You&rsquo;d see no team play more than once, you&rsquo;d be in no stadium more than once.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Now that I had a problem worth solving, how to solve it? The sheer number of games makes it pretty clear that this is a task that can&rsquo;t be solved by brute force. There are 2430 games in a regular season of baseball. The possible number of any selection of 15 of those games is 4.45 × 10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->38<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Even if I could check a trillion schedules a second (which I can&rsquo;t), it would still take 14 billion billion years (at which point, even the Red Sox would probably have a new stadium). If you visualized the problem as a graph, each game would be a node and each travel day would be an edge. The problem was that every game had an edge that led to every game that came after it. What I needed to do first was prune this tree.</p>\n<p>So I made some assumptions for the sake of making a reasonable road trip. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wouldn&rsquo;t want more than 2 days off between games, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to travel more than 500 miles on any given day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This change trimmed the 3-million-plus edges into a mere 86,000. But an exhaustive search would still take a prohibitively long time: at that same impossible speed, I&rsquo;d have my answer in merely 11 billion years. I made the problem more than a billion times smaller, but realistically I wasn&rsquo;t any closer to the solution.</p>\n<p>It was about this time that I decided I was never going to get the perfect answer.

				"content_text": "Last April, to no one in particular, I <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/Plutor/statuses/56353803930304512\">asked the following question</a>:\n\n<blockquote>\"What's the shortest possible trip (in miles) to see every MLB team play at least one game this season?\"</blockquote>\n\nIt became clear, after a brief discussion with some friends, that the shortest possible trip is somewhere on the order of a hundred miles. Citi Field in the Bronx and Yankee Stadium in Queens are only 6 miles apart. Since the Mets and the Yankees are in different leagues and each team <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_schedule#Recent_season_schedules\">plays one series at home</a> against every other team in its own league, you could just spend the whole season going back and forth between the two stadiums. (In fact, I'd be surprised if at least one New Yorker baseball fan with time and money to burn hadn't done exactly this.)\n\nIn order to avoid this \"trivial\" solution, a modification to the puzzle would have to be introduced. After throwing around a bunch of attempts, I hit upon the perfect goal: <strong>15 games, 15 stadiums, 30 teams</strong>. You'd see no team play more than once, you'd be in no stadium more than once.\n\n<!--more--><img src=\"http://plutor.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/figure2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Directed acyclic graph\" width=\"260\" height=\"231\" align=\"left\" style=\"padding: 10px\" /> Now that I had a problem worth solving, how to solve it? The sheer number of games makes it pretty clear that this is a task that can't be solved by brute force. There are 2430 games in a regular season of baseball. The possible number of any selection of 15 of those games is 4.45 × 10<sup>38</sup>. Even if I could check a trillion schedules a second (which I can't), it would still take 14 billion billion years (at which point, even the Red Sox would probably have a new stadium). If you visualized the problem as a graph, each game would be a node and each travel day would be an edge. The problem was that every game had an edge that led to every game that came after it. What I needed to do first was prune this tree.\n\nSo I made some assumptions for the sake of making a reasonable road trip. <strong>I wouldn't want more than 2 days off between games, and I wouldn't want to travel more than 500 miles on any given day.</strong> This change trimmed the 3-million-plus edges into a mere 86,000. But an exhaustive search would still take a prohibitively long time: at that same impossible speed, I'd have my answer in merely 11 billion years. I made the problem more than a billion times smaller, but realistically I wasn't any closer to the solution.\n\nIt was about this time that I decided I was never going to get the perfect answer. I would have to resign myself to a Good Enough plan that could be calculated before the heat death of the universe (or better yet, before Opening Day). I brushed up on my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem\">Traveling Salesman Problem</a> and pathfinding algorithms like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\">A*</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm\">Dijkstra's</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_algorithm\">Floyd-Warshall</a>. But my problem had a couple of quirks that made those approaches unsuitable:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>With both A* and Dijkstra's, you have defined starting and destination nodes. I did not want to specify either. I wanted the schedule (and the map) to dictate the best time of the season to take the trip.</li>\n\t<li>Pretty much every algorithm I read about optimizes for total distance, and nothing else. A perfect road trip might start at Wrigley and end at US Cellular a month later, but it most definitely would not be the shortest distance between those two points.</li>\n\t<li>Most importantly, I was <em>very particular</em> about exactly which nodes could be on the same schedule. Two games might not have an overlap, but once I decided to go to both of them, the options for the third game get narrowed down. Likewise for every step along the way.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/plutor/6151190691/in/set-72157623141670212/\"><img src=\"http://plutor.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/6151190691_61bb6741ef_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Fenway Roof Deck\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" align=\"right\" style=\"padding: 10px\" /></a> After three or four false starts (and one moment where a bug in my data structure made an exhaustive search running a couple quadrillion times faster than it should), I happened upon a promising technique. <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/8508796/53060\">A commenter on Stack Overflow</a> recommended (in response to a purposely vague question) doing a sort of prioritized breadth-first search. What I ended up doing was starting with a list of all of the one-game plans (2430 plan, one for each game). And then I did this:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Remove the plan with the shortest average leg length from the list (ties are unimportant -- pick arbitrarily)</li>\n\t<li>Look at every game that you could add to the end of that plan that meets the restrictions: 2 or fewer off days, no more than 500 miles of travel per day.</li>\n\t<li>For every one of those games, check if it's legal to add to this plan (check for team duplications against every game already on the plan)</li>\n\t<li>If there are no duplicates, add it to the list of plans. Since each game has a couple dozen possible \"next\" games, this will likely result in the number of plans in the list growing.</li>\n\t<li>If there are more than some number of plans in the list, discard the longest ones. (After some experimentation, I went with about half a million. Much more on this another time.)</li>\n</ol>\n\nAnd I repeated until the \"shortest plan\" was 15 games long.

Here's what we wrote up for it:\n\n<blockquote>We would like to propose taking a page from Atlassian's playbook and instituting a \"FedEx Day\". The idea is that for one day, all of the developers and QA would be free to work on a product or feature of their own choosing. The only rules would be that they have to work with someone who they don't normally work with and that the next morning they have a finished product to demo to the whole team, something that they can “ship”, ergo “FedEx Day”.  This is a lightweight version of Google’s 70/20/10 policy, where the majority of an employee’s time is spent doing their traditional job, 20% on company related innovation, and 10% on anything.\n<!--more-->\nPeople don't stay at Texterity because of the money.

I used the standard 5x5 stats, but you can change those pretty easily. It took about 90 minutes to run a million seasons on my not-state-of-the-art computer.\n\n<p class=\"update\"><strong>Update 11 Feb</strong>: This morning, I realized that these numbers were off, in particular those of pitchers. I had been miscalculating team ERA: just averaging all of the players together. The problem is that the true team ERA value is IP-weighted: Total team ER divided by total team IP. So it was over-valuing players with good ERA and few IP, like relief pitchers. The same was similarly true about WHIP and BA, so everyone who didn't play much was being given too much credit. I've updated the code and re-run a million seasons. There are a lot of starting pitchers rated highly now, 8 of the top 10 and thirteen of the top twenty. But actually, the top hundred players are <i>exactly</i> 50/50 batters and pitchers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"update\"><strong>Update 14 Feb</strong>: I changed the spreadsheet so it includes Marcel's predicted stats for each player. This should make it easier to see why each player might be ranked where he is, plus make it easier to use on Draft Day. I updated the code linked to above, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"update\"><strong>Update 22 Mar</strong>: A couple of last minute tweaks before my draft tonight. I couple weeks ago I added code to remove the \"chaff\" players (really, only the top couple hundred players will be drafted in a fantasy league, so I shouldn't be comparing Pujols against the 1000th-best batter). And a co-worker noticed David Ortiz missing from the list, which revealed a bug in the way I was dealing with players who play no positions. Also, I've <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/spring2011/news/story?id=6154112\">removed hands-down first-round pitcher Adam Wainwright</a> from the stats list.</p>\n",

Brian tried to get anywhere at all in Dragon's Lair (and succeeded, I think).  M and I played Frogger and Pong (both predate a \"free play\" dip, so you had to get free tokens from an attendant).  We played a whole bunch of Flash Gordon pinball.  The graphics on Asteroids are eye-piercingly bright.  Ms. Pac-Man has <em>legs</em> and she chases <em>furbees</em>.  Winner of the award for \"game I never heard of before but loved\": <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Race\">Omega Race</a>.</li>\n\t<li>The worst part of the weekend was the Friday night concert.  The concert itself, actually, not so bad.  But we showed up about 90 minutes early for the line to get good seats in the balcony.  And then what do they do?  They force the people in the front of the line to fill in from the sides first.  Guh.  We argued our point and the excellent Enforcer agreed and let us move.  But then the concert started like an hour late and I didn't want to listen to three hours of opening acts to get to MC Frontalot.  So I listened to the Protomen and then told myself I'd see Frontalot another time.</li>\n\t<li>PC freeplay was fantastic.  A couple hundred high-end computers all set up and networked and with a bunch of Steam games loaded up.  We played hours and hours of Left 4 Dead 2.  I think I might buy it.</li>\n\t<li>Console freeplay was also good, especially if you show up early.  We went first thing both Saturday and Sunday, and was able to grab a game with almost zero wait.  But by the time we left each day, there was a big crowd.  Played some Boom Blox (which I was told by an passer-by is the \"best Wii game\"), and Little Big Planet.</li>\n\t<li>The expo floor on Friday: a madhouse, totally terrible.  On Sunday: much better.  Big ups to <a href=\"http://www.slamboltscrappers.com/\">Slam Bolt Scrappers</a>, a fun indie multi-player Tetris-inspired battle strategy game, and Split/Second, a beautiful racing game that gets the HUD just right (i.e. almost none at all).</li>\n\t<li>3D displays were all the rage, especially at the nVidia booth.  Worth it?  Sometimes.  Will they take off?  Not sure.  Raise your hand if you're looking forward to wearing special glasses to play games.</li>\n\t<li>Starcraft II was at the nVidia booth (or maybe just near it), but the line was about five people deep and it was clear that everyone wanted fifteen minutes with the game.  They could have planned that booth better.</li>\n\t<li>Wil Wheaton was great.  He mentioned Pandemic during his keynote, and implied that it was a fun co-op board game.  We tried two or three times to get it from the library, and the <em>one</em> time it was available, I didn't take it because it's a 4-player game and we had a group of seven.  Since then, I've heard two or three negative reviews so I'm not sure what to think anymore.</li>\n\t<li>We did get Bang! from the library, which was great fun.  We also played a bunch of Fluxx (including the Monty Python flavor) and Munchkin Fu (ninjas) and Munchkin Booty (pirates) at the same time.  I won a <a href=\"http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/coin/\">Munchkin silver piece</a> when an Enforcer walked by just as we were packing up.</li>\n\t<li>The Hynes Convention Center is kind of a dump, and was clearly not big enough for the crowds.  I hope they move it to the BCEC next year.  PAX East has a three-year contract, but I think the two conference centers are managed by the same company, which would hopefully make moving it pretty easy.  <span class=\"update\">Update 29 Mar, 2pm: Huzzah, confirmed! PAX East 2011 and 2012 <a href=\"http://news.bigdownload.com/2010/03/29/pax-east-2011-and-2012-to-move-to-bigger-venue/\">will be at the BCEC</a>!</span></li>\n\t<li class=\"update\">Added 29 Mar, 2pm: The swag bags you got at the door in contained a really small (30 cards?! Really?) but playable Magic: The Gathering deck. Firstly, I hope the guy who came up with the pre-built Magic deck got promoted. Secondly, we were able to sit down in line and start playing four-person Magic games without having to try to remember the rules at all.  There were several \"riding a bike\" similes made.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Not only am I trying to figure out how to fit my new Kindle (thanks, Mom and Dad!) into my reading habits, but I also hope to get fiction recommendations from other people for 2010 so I can try to divide my time 50/50.  Right now there are four books on my nightstand, and they're all non-fiction.  What a bad start to that New Year's resolution.\n\nHere are the books I read this year, and my thoughts on some of them:\n<!--more--><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2517439.The_Forever_War\">The Forever War</a> by Dexter Filkins</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2200247.The_Ten_Most_Beautiful_Experiments\">The Ten Most Beautiful Experiments</a> by George Johnson</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1044355.When_You_Are_Engulfed_in_Flames\">When You Are Engulfed in Flames</a> by David Sedaris</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/645180.Soon_I_Will_Be_Invincible\">Soon I Will Be Invincible</a> by Austin Grossman</strong> - Probably my favorite book of the year. It's got a superheroes-are-imperfect <i>Watchmen</i> vibe going on, but it's less of a distopian view and more of a \"day in the life of\" the participants. I'm also apparently a sucker for novels with an alternating first-person gimmick (see also <i>The Time Traveler's Wife</i>). I'd be lying if I said I didn't visualize Neil Patrick Harris as the super-intelligent villain.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297673.The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao\">The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</a> by Junot DÃ­az</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917.Outliers\">Outliers</a> by Malcolm Gladwell</strong> - This is the first book that I think I've read that has colored the way I read <em>other</em> non-fiction books. How Bill Gates got a lot of computer experience in High School in the 70s was an especially interesting bit.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3507618.Fruitless_Fall_The_Collapse_of_the_Honeybee_and_the_Coming_Agricultural_Crisis\">Fruitless Fall: The Collapse of the Honeybee and the Coming Agricultural Crisis</a> by Rowan Jacobsen</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4573498.The_Gardner_Heist_The_True_Story_of_the_World_s_Largest_Unsolved_Art_Theft\">The Gardner Heist: The True Story of the World's Largest Unsolved Art Theft</a> by Ulrich Boser</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2628017.The_Year_s_Best_Science_Fiction_25th_Annual_Collection\">The Year's Best Science Fiction: 25th Annual Collection</a> by Gardner R. Dozois</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6057309.Born_to_Run_The_Rise_of_Ultra_running_and_the_Super_athlete_Tribe\">Born to Run: The Rise of Ultra-running and the Super-athlete Tribe</a> by Christopher McDougall</strong> - Started out slowly with some interesting ultra-runner stories, and escalated into a fantastic tale about the author taking part in a 50-plus mile run in the Mexican desert with some professionals and some legendary native runners. Makes a persuasive case that long-distance running is the <em>reason</em> humans started walking upright.</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road\">The Road</a> by Cormac McCarthy</strong> - No, wait, maybe this is my pick for book of the year.  The Road was intense and bleak and depressing.  My favorite thing about this book is that McCarthy didn't try to give it a story arc or a moral or a hero.  It's just a guy and his son trying to get by in an impossible situation.  So real, so tragic.</li>\n</ul>\n\nSee also <a href=\"http://plutor.org/blog/2009/01/12/2008-in-books/\">2008</a>, <a href=\"http://plutor.org/blog/2008/01/02/2007-in-books/\">2007</a>, <a href=\"http://plutor.org/blog/2006/12/28/book-reviews-for-2006-part-2/\">2006</a>, and <a href=\"http://plutor.org/blog/2005/12/01/093025/\">2005</a>.\n",

I have some very excellent reasons that I figured I should put in writing for easy reference.\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Proactive non-reason: <strong>I <em>don't</em> hate Apple</strong>.  I think their hardware is beautiful and I think Mac OS X is one of the most usable Operating Systems around (although it's got a learning curve like any OS does).  Their prices are on the high end of reasonable, considering the hardware is generally top-of-the-line and well-built.</li>\n\t<li>Proactive non-reason: <strong>I am <em>pro</em>-open-source</strong>.  I think <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27_Law\">Linus' Law</a> is spot on, and I think that \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar\">Release Early, Release Often</a>\" is a faster way to quality software.  But I'm <em>not</em> an ideologue.  I run Linux exclusively at work, but also I use plenty of closed-source applications without complaining.  I'll even purchase DRM-ed media without much grumbling.</li>\n\t<li><strong>I like to build my own computers</strong>.  There's something about the hundreds of interlocking details that appeals to my nature.  The challenge of learning (or re-learning) interfaces and chipsets and how memory works is exciting.  (Aside: I find the enjoyment that I get from following sports to be somewhat similar.  They're complex worlds with details that are <i>almost</i> entirely self-consistent.  And its the exceptions and quirks that make them enticing.)</li>\n\t<li>Unfortunately, <strong>Mac OS X doesn't work on non-Apple hardware</strong>, at least not officially.  And I don't feel comfortable applying a delicate hack <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2007/08/leopard-successfully-run-on-non-apple-hardware.ars\">that will make that work</a> on my every-day machine.</li>\n\t<li><strong>My wife needs Windows</strong> for phone syncing and work applications.  As a doctor, there are a number of applications she runs on her phone and at home to access charts and medical databases.  Some of them have iPhone options, and a couple have cripped web versions, but none of them that I know of yet have a full-featured client that will work under either Mac OS X or Linux client.</li>\n\t<li><strong>I like to play games</strong>.  I do it less than I did back in college, but I still spend five or six hours a week playing Team Fortress 2 or Trackmania or a number of other games.  There are few Mac OS X or Linux versions of most games: Windows is by far the most popular gaming platform.  (Gaming works well in Parallels within Mac OS X, but you still need a Windows install/license.)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dual booting is more trouble than it's worth</strong>.  I have no problem with Windows.  In fact, so far, Windows 7 is really nice and stable and it plays nice with all of my hardware.  I have several good reasons to use Windows, but no compelling reason to use something else.  So I have no reason to go through the effort to set up a second OS.</li>\n</ol>\n",

He made a comment about ACL not usually having much R&B, but I think he probably convinced them it was a smart move.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Kings of Leon</strong> - I only caught about the last 20 minutes of their show (I was at the Yeah Yeah Yeahs during most of it) but they were great.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mute Math</strong> - I wasn't expecting a lot from their show, but they're way high energy.  The lead singer finished off the show by playing something that looked like a guitar-shaped theramin.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Flogging Molly</strong> - In the rain.  That was something special.  They went long, though, which was surprisingly annoying.</li>\n\t<li><strong>STS9</strong> - Missed half of their show (I was at John Vanderslice and The Scabs), but their electronica is just so fun.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ghostland Observatory</strong> - I had never heard of them before, but they were recommended (and it was them or Dave Matthews at the end of day 2).  Two guys and the most kickass light show I had ever seen.  Possibly my favorite act of the weekend.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ben Harper and Relentless7</strong> - From what I hear, very different from Ben Harper's solo stuff.  Reminded me of Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, which leads me to believe their non-live stuff might not be as exciting as the show was.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Girl Talk</strong> - This was the 25,000 person dance party near the end of day 3.  An amazing way to end the weekend.  A very close second for best act.</li>\n</ul>\n\nShows that were disappointing:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>The Walkmen</strong> - For certain types of music, yelling instead of singing is okay.  This wasn't one of them.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong> - Not terrible, I just had never realized how similar all their songs sounded.  Wish I had gone to all of Kings of Leon's show instead.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mos Def</strong> - He came on 20 minutes late, played drums(!) for two great songs, and then bullshitted with the band for ten minutes before doing another song.  Decided to bail in favor of John Vanderslice.</li>\n\t<li><strong>The B-52s</strong> - What was I even expecting?</li>\n</ul>\n\nI'll have photos up as soon as CVS gets their act together and develops them.

				"content_text": "Just over a year ago, I was sitting in a classroom at Sun's virtually deserted Burlington campus, learning a new programming language from a living human in person for possibly the first time in my whole life.  The class itself was a little slow; it definitely wasn't geared towards experienced developers.  But it was more effective learning than fiddling at work had been, since it successfully prevented all distractions.  Now that I've had a year to work with the language (and have gone back and forth to programming in Perl), there's several reasons why I'm still using Java.\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Strong typing</strong>: Perl has no <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language\">type safety</a>, and I used to think that was an asset.  But when you have a dozen programmers working on hundreds of source files, type conflicts can easily get introduced and go undetected for a long time.  Objects are hashes, references are scalars, and arrays are quietly scalar-ized.</li>\n\t<li><strong>WAR files</strong>: Releasing a new version of a website is brainless with Java.  See that .war file that was built by Eclipse or Maven?  Copy it to your server.  Done.</li>\n\t<li><strong>JUnit, Hibernate, Spring, log4j</strong>: Perl has a lot of freely available modules.  But not a single one of them is as useful as Hibernate alone.  It encapsulates database objects transparently, and is remarkably flexible.  We've got a lot of awkward legacy database schemas, and without Hibernate's flexibility, we'd be building database objects by hand with JDBC.  Spring's dependency injection and session management, JUnit's unit testing mechanisms, log4j's logging simplicity, and Maven's build architecture mean we spend less time planning and re-planning the infrastructure of our applications and more time implementing functionality.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Eclipse</strong>: I know that there are Perl plugins for eclipse (EPIC in particular), but they never added that much useful functionality as far as I was concerned.  Having a full-featured IDE with method completion and inline error display saves me huge amounts of time.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Everything is a reference</strong>: Java's object-oriented nature reminds me a lot of C++ (that's the OO language I have the most experience with) except for the lack of the object/pointer paradigm.  The fact that everything (okay, okay, besides primitives) is a reference keeps me from having to remember all of my pointer-management skills.</li>\n</ol>\n\nI could probably come up with a dozen other reasons that I enjoy programming in Java, but those are the big ones that make my life easy.\n",

But actually looking on the list, I'm having a hard time picking out my favorites.  Here's the list of the books, along with some notes on the books I particularly enjoyed.\n\n<!--more-->\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0060852569\">Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life</a> by Kingsolver, Barbara</strong> - This is my pick for Book of the Year.  Kingsolver's family spent the entire year eating only food that they grew, raised, or traded for.  She reveals how little we know about the food we buy at the grocery store, and this book has made me much more conscious of the source of my food.  I'm not strictly a <a href=\"http://www.locavores.com/\">locavore</a>, but this book pushed me in that direction.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0375713719\">Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word</a> by Kennedy, Randall</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1594482675\">The New Kings of Nonfiction</a> by Glass, Ira</strong> - A great collection of short non-fiction collected by the host of This American Life.  They're all fantastic examples of clever storytelling.</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0930289234\">Watchmen</a> by Moore, Alan</strong> - I had heard of and about this comic book for years, and I decided I should finally read it before the movie comes out in March.  I got it from the library, and before I had a chance to start it, M grabbed it and became engrossed.  She hates comic books, but she liked this one.  I can't think of a higher compliment.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0743291476\">The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible As Literally As Possible </a> by Jacobs, A.J.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0807050210\">Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919</a> by Puleo, Stephen</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0393324818\">Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game</a> by Lewis, Michael</strong> - Not quite as stirring as his <i>Blind Side</i>, but a solid book about baseball drafting, statistics, and money.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0374528373\">The Brothers Karamazov</a> by Dostoevsky, Fyodor</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0671746723\">Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</a> by Adams, Douglas</strong> - I read Adams's <i>Hitchhiker</i> books growing up, and I loved them.  I remember trying to start this once and putting it down in the first chapter.  Reading it again, it definitely starts slowly, but it's an amusing book.  It was nice to be able to read something brand new in a familiar voice that died too young.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0743299396\">No One Belongs Here More Than You</a> by July, Miranda</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/076790818X\">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a> by Bryson, Bill </li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1860542387\">Don't Shoot the Dog!</a> by Pryor, Karen</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1400033535\">Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain</a> by Sacks, Oliver W.</li>\n</ul>\n\nSee also by book lists for <a href=\"http://plutor.org/blog/2008/01/02/2007-in-books/\">2007</a>, <a href=\"http://plutor.org/blog/2006/12/28/book-reviews-for-2006-part-2/\">2006</a>, and <a href=\"http://plutor.org/blog/2005/12/01/093025/\">2005</a>.\n",

The rule before then was that Kerry would have been replaced Republican then-Governor Mitt Romney if he had won the Presidential election.\n\nWhoever replaced Kerry or Kennedy would be the first new Senator from Massachusetts in more than 24 years.\n",

There are at least 9 more points listed on my Netflix queue (<a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0477348/\"><i>No Country For Old Men</i></a>, <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0469494/\"><i>There Will Be Blood</i></a>, and <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0401383/\"><i>The Butterfly And The Diving Bell</i></a>), but I doubt any of those DVDs will come out before the awards <s>ceremony</s> press release.\n",

Joel Spolsky <!-- raw HTML omitted -->responded with the answer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Apple and Microsoft have very different priorities when it comes to font rendering, and at current screen sizes and resolutions, Apple&rsquo;s total respect for the letter shapes can mean blurriness.  Their diligence becomes especially impressive when you consider the work that Apple must have had to go through to get Safari to run on Microsoft&rsquo;s home turf but render fonts the way it would on Mac OS X.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Shea piped in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with his own opinion and a caveat: I like Mac&rsquo;s look better, but I think Microsoft&rsquo;s is a better choice for the medium.

Which brings us back to what Jeff Atwood does best: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a big post with research and quotes and numbers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> showing how far screens have come since the release of the PC AT and Macintosh.

				"content_text": "The release of a beta of Apple's Safari for Windows earlier this week has resulted in an interesting flurry of activity in web designer circles.  Nevermind the instant security bugs and the quick release of fixes from Apple.  I'm talking about typography.\n\nThe day that the beta came out, Jeff Atwood <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000884.html\">asked \"What's wrong with Apple's font rendering?\"</a>  He pointed out that others had discussed this before, but it wasn't until the difference was visible side-by-side on the exact same machine with the exact same fonts (and with presumably the exact same font libraries) that it became truly surprising.  Joel Spolsky <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/12.html\">responded with the answer</a>: Apple and Microsoft have very different priorities when it comes to font rendering, and at current screen sizes and resolutions, Apple's total respect for the letter shapes can mean blurriness.  Their diligence becomes especially impressive when you consider the work that Apple must have had to go through to get Safari to run on Microsoft's home turf but render fonts the way it would on Mac OS X.\n\n<a href=\"http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2007/06/12/a_subpixel_s/\">Dave Shea piped in</a> with his own opinion and a caveat: I like Mac's look better, but I think Microsoft's is a better choice for the medium.  But more importantly, he points out that as soon as higher-DPI screens are available, the whole question will be moot.  Microsoft's deference to the pixel grid will be essentially meaningless.  Which brings us back to what Jeff Atwood does best: <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000886.html\">a big post with research and quotes and numbers</a> showing how far screens have come since the release of the PC AT and Macintosh.  Not far.  The sad realization:\n\n<blockquote>Short of some kind of miraculous technological breakthrough, I can't see computer displays reaching 200 DPI in \"a few years\". It's unlikely we'll even get there in ten years. I'd love to be proven wrong, but all the evidence of history-- not to mention typical consumer \"bigger is better\" behavior-- is overwhelming.</blockquote>\n\nCan <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2006/10/05/fujitsu-shows-off-color-e-ink-tablet-concept/\">e-ink</a> or <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com.au/reviews/coolgear/electronics/soa/Tech-Guide-Organic-LEDs-The-future-of-displays/0,139023382,120273393,00.htm\">OLED</a> be the miraculous technological breakthrough we need?  Possibly, but neither of them are yet ready to replace CRTs or LCDs.\n\n<sup>[1]</sup> The always brilliant Joel ends with a great metaphor about how people usually prefer what's familiar.  He doesn't say it, but I think he was implying that this is a big contributor to entrenchment in computing holywars: Mac vs. PC, vi vs. emacs, KNF vs. OTBS.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In November, I participated in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->National Novel Writing Month<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Sadly, I only made it about 2500 words in before getting wrapped up in, whaddyacallit, you know, life.  I&rsquo;m glad I gave it a brief whirl, but I hope to give it a better thrashing in 2007.  Here&rsquo;s the dull introduction to my half-plotted story, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Assuming Perfection<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Unless you were there on a Saturday morning. It wasnâ€™t so much ritual as it was habit. The lawn mower was dustedâ€”yes, dustedâ€”and brought to the driveway. The hinges and screws and belts were checked. The gas tank was topped off, and the oil was as well. And only then, the lawn was mowed; not immaculately, but diligently.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, the edger came out. The steps were the same. And the blade touched the grass and did what edgers do. And before the edger or the lawn mower went away, they were wiped, occasionally scrubbed, and always oiled (to prevent rusting).</p>\n<p>Saturdays were spent cleaning, and Sundays were for shopping. A manâ€™s home is never finished, Roland would say. Nothing was ever quite right: the front door was the wrong shade of blue one week, and the knocker clashed. The sprinkler did the ksh-ksh-ksh a little too fast, and watered in a thoroughly disorganized manner. Shoes got scuffed, socks got worn through. And even the most stylish of men tired of the same style clothes.</p>\n<p>This particular Sunday, Roland had come back home with deceptively full bags. They contained a number of pillows of differing thicknesses and materials. He had stood at the store, trying to imagine sleeping. The mattresses and the pillows were, perplexingly, halfway across the store from each other, which had made the task a greater challenge.</p>\n<p>â€œHow am I to know whether Iâ€™m a side sleeper or a back sleeper?â€ he had thought. â€œI know how I wake up. And I know how I am most comfortable when I am trying to fall asleep. But they are not the same. How can I be sure whichâ€”if eitherâ€”is the way I spend most of the night?â€</p>\n<p>He considered returning home to set up a video camera to watch himself sleep that night. â€œBut,â€ he reasoned quietly, â€œwould being conscious of the video taping make me self-conscious of the way Iâ€™m laying? Will I sleep the way Iâ€™m most comfortable sleeping? Or will I sleep the way Iâ€™m most comfortable being watched? Once the camera is off and the pillow is decided on, I may regret it.â€ And he didnâ€™t like the idea of keeping the camera in his room for the rest of his life, just to be sure of getting a satisfactory nightâ€™s sleep.</p>\n<p>Roland had tried to try each pillow in the store, pressing it against his head in a manner which roughly approximated sleeping at home. It wasnâ€™t long before he realized that the uncontrolled factorsâ€”the plastic wrapper around the pillow, the inability to actually lay down, the way he could only support a portion of the bottom of the pillow with his armsâ€”meant that this method of gaining information was a futile effort at best.</p>\n<p>In the end, he had decided on a rare course of action: he purchased four entirely different pillows. He felt he had had little choice in the matter. The storeâ€™s poor layout made it impossible to make a firm decision. And even then, he couldnâ€™t unwrap the pillows. He would just have to return next week with the pillows he disliked.</p>\n<p>Although Roland normally would have felt defeated by having to resort to a purchase that he was sure he would not keep, in this case he returned home in high spirits.</p>\n<p>Rolandâ€™s house sat at a dead end at the very top of a small, bare hill, not far from the center of town. It wasnâ€™t very large, but his continuous upkeep and desire for improvement gave it the appearance of an illustration, not of reality. Like the yard, the trees and gardens were well-maintained. The tall brown fence kept the neighborhood dogsâ€™ trouble out.

He felt there was a good chance that heâ€™d be able to discard at least one of pillows as completely unacceptable after that short period of time, and would give each of the remaining pillows at least one additional night.

His father had drilled this into him as a child: â€œFloss your teeth, Roland, what did you have for breakfast yesterday?â€ Eggs, sunny side up; toast with raspberry jam; cottage cheese, small curd. â€œNow brush, where did you go this afternoon?â€ To the barber, then to the laundromat to do a load of whites with bleach, then home to put a second coat of varnish on the front stairwayâ€™s left railing. â€œUse the toilet, how many tomato seedlings did you plant in the front garden?â€ Seven. And four basil seedlings, and a full package of trellis cucumbers in the rear. â€œWash your hands and face, which pillow are you going to sleep on tonight?â€</p>\n<p>Roland stood in the bathroom doorway, hands and face unwashed, staring at the four pillows lined up on his blue duvet.

The grit and the smoke and the smog and the general filth and stagnant air of the city forced Roland to keep the windows closed today. It was the first beautiful spring day of the year, as far as he could remember, but even if he could bring himself to crack open the windows on his red Honda, heâ€™d regret it.

There was a yellow car in the spot where he always parked. A dented yellow sedan. He couldnâ€™t determine the make; the emblems were gone, and there were rust spots where the bolts previously keeping them attached had punctured the body. The yellow was not even a uniform yellow: it was stained as if with cigarette smoke. No, he corrected himself, exhaust. As far as he could tell, it had parked on the side of the highway, bathed in exhaust for the entire fifteen years since it was constructed.

				"content_text": "In November, I participated in <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.com/\">National Novel Writing Month</a>.  Sadly, I only made it about 2500 words in before getting wrapped up in, whaddyacallit, you know, life.  I'm glad I gave it a brief whirl, but I hope to give it a better thrashing in 2007.  Here's the dull introduction to my half-plotted story, <i>Assuming Perfection</i>:\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>The best way to know Roland was to see his lawn edger: it shined like the day it was made. It sat in his garage, next to the labeled green plastic bins of lime and fetilizer, and just under the three snow shovels. Standing in his garage, in fact, gave the impression that you werenâ€™t in a place that was used so much as stocked. Looking closely, the pattern of slight wear on the handles if the edger was fairly visible. But had the blade ever really touched soil? Itâ€™d be impossible to be sure.\n\nUnless you were there on a Saturday morning. It wasnâ€™t so much ritual as it was habit. The lawn mower was dustedâ€”yes, dustedâ€”and brought to the driveway. The hinges and screws and belts were checked. The gas tank was topped off, and the oil was as well. And only then, the lawn was mowed; not immaculately, but diligently.\n\nAfterwards, the edger came out. The steps were the same. And the blade touched the grass and did what edgers do. And before the edger or the lawn mower went away, they were wiped, occasionally scrubbed, and always oiled (to prevent rusting).\n\nSaturdays were spent cleaning, and Sundays were for shopping. A manâ€™s home is never finished, Roland would say. Nothing was ever quite right: the front door was the wrong shade of blue one week, and the knocker clashed. The sprinkler did the ksh-ksh-ksh a little too fast, and watered in a thoroughly disorganized manner. Shoes got scuffed, socks got worn through. And even the most stylish of men tired of the same style clothes.\n\nThis particular Sunday, Roland had come back home with deceptively full bags. They contained a number of pillows of differing thicknesses and materials. He had stood at the store, trying to imagine sleeping. The mattresses and the pillows were, perplexingly, halfway across the store from each other, which had made the task a greater challenge.\n\nâ€œHow am I to know whether Iâ€™m a side sleeper or a back sleeper?â€ he had thought. â€œI know how I wake up. And I know how I am most comfortable when I am trying to fall asleep. But they are not the same. How can I be sure whichâ€”if eitherâ€”is the way I spend most of the night?â€\n\nHe considered returning home to set up a video camera to watch himself sleep that night. â€œBut,â€ he reasoned quietly, â€œwould being conscious of the video taping make me self-conscious of the way Iâ€™m laying? Will I sleep the way Iâ€™m most comfortable sleeping? Or will I sleep the way Iâ€™m most comfortable being watched? Once the camera is off and the pillow is decided on, I may regret it.â€ And he didnâ€™t like the idea of keeping the camera in his room for the rest of his life, just to be sure of getting a satisfactory nightâ€™s sleep.\n\nRoland had tried to try each pillow in the store, pressing it against his head in a manner which roughly approximated sleeping at home. It wasnâ€™t long before he realized that the uncontrolled factorsâ€”the plastic wrapper around the pillow, the inability to actually lay down, the way he could only support a portion of the bottom of the pillow with his armsâ€”meant that this method of gaining information was a futile effort at best.\n\nIn the end, he had decided on a rare course of action: he purchased four entirely different pillows. He felt he had had little choice in the matter. The storeâ€™s poor layout made it impossible to make a firm decision. And even then, he couldnâ€™t unwrap the pillows. He would just have to return next week with the pillows he disliked.\n\nAlthough Roland normally would have felt defeated by having to resort to a purchase that he was sure he would not keep, in this case he returned home in high spirits.\n\nRolandâ€™s house sat at a dead end at the very top of a small, bare hill, not far from the center of town. It wasnâ€™t very large, but his continuous upkeep and desire for improvement gave it the appearance of an illustration, not of reality. Like the yard, the trees and gardens were well-maintained. The tall brown fence kept the neighborhood dogsâ€™ trouble out. Roland himself had always feared being a poor pet-owner, and had never got up the courage to even seriously consider the idea.\n\nRoland returned home to a dark home at the tail end of dusk. He closed the garage doors, noting again that the loud motor needed to be re-oiled before too long. From the driveway, he walked the brick walkway to his front door, unlocked, and entered.\n\nWhen he turned the light on, he saw exactly what he always expected to see: the main stairway leading directly from the front door, straight up to the second floor. To his left was his living room, where he occasionally would spend an evening reading and where he planned to disassemble and rebuild the garage door opener. To the right of the stairs was a door to a coat closet hardly large enough to hold his three coats.\n\nHe walked past the living room to the kitchen. He felt a pang of guilt over having spent a small fortune on the dark granite countertop, and he tried to think consciously about how much it increased the resale value of the house. That, the stainless steel fridge and the island with the six-burner stove made this a kitchen he was quite proud of.\n\nUpstairs, in the only bedroom, he placed the two bags of pillows on the floor. He had been thinking since he left the store how he was going to schedule the pillow testing. Seven clearly does not divide easily into four. How sure could he be after a single nightâ€™s sleep that any one pillow was or was not satisfactory enough? Should he set an alarm for halfway through the night so he could switch pillows?\n\nHe discarded that last thought with a quiet chuckle.\n\nThe plan Roland had settled on was this: he would give each pillow a single nightâ€™s sleep as a preliminary test. He felt there was a good chance that heâ€™d be able to discard at least one of pillows as completely unacceptable after that short period of time, and would give each of the remaining pillows at least one additional night.

(Of course, last year's favorite didn't win..)\n\n<p class=\"update\">Update 26 Feb: For the first time since 2003, I saw the winner of the Oscar for Best Picture (<i>The Departed</i>) in a first-run theater before the night of the awards.  That was the only additional top-award nominee I saw, but it brought my total up to six.  The only other award winner I've seen is <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0497116/\"><i>An Inconvenient Truth</i></a>, which I coincidentally saw just this weekend.</p>\n",

As far as I know, such a rule has never been adopted.</li>\n<li><strong>4.12(a)(7), 4.12(a)(8), and 4.12(a)(9)</strong> - The NL can adopt a rule making games that have been stopped before regulation (for instance, because of rain) a \"suspended game\" instead of \"no game\".</li>\n<li><strong>6.02(d)</strong> - The NL had to follow this experimental rule in 2006, essentially saying that the batter could not leave the batter's box unless either team was making a substitution or calling a conference.  I have no idea if they're planning to make it permanent.</li>\n<li><strong>10.23(b)</strong> - In the AL, the league pitching champion must have pitched at least as many innings as the number of games each team played that season (162 this year).  In the NL, the champion only needed to have pitched 80% that many innings (129.6).  As far as I can tell, this rule rarely, if ever, actually matters.  The top pitchers in both leagues usually pitch at least 190 innings a year.</li>\n</ul>\n",

If anyone got advance information, it's the NYT.  And I could totally see them \"accidentally\" putting it on their wire.  On the other hand, it claims that Wii Sports will be included with \"every Wii\", and we already know that that's not true for Japan.</p>\n<p class=\"update\">Update 9:40: <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-09-14-wii-date_x.htm\">USA Today confirms</a> the NYT's info, plus includes a photo of the all-important box.

Only one remote but including Wii Sports.  Remotes for $40.  Plus some other interesting features, like the Miis (personal avatars that you can copy to the remote to bring to a friend's house), Wii channels, and free Internet play.  Guess it's time to start saving up and counting down the minutes.</p>\n<p class=\"update\">Update 14:31: This is the last update, I swear.  There are <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/14/nintendo-releases-wii-promo-materials-games-list/\">52 Wii games</a>, including both first- and third-party, scheduled for release before the end of March.  That's quite a lineup.  Compare it to the Gamecube launch: a dismal <em>three</em> launch titles, and only 12 within the first month.  Most were simple ports, and only one was even close to a first-party franchise (Luigi's Mansion).</p>\n",

More are pending!\n\n<p class=\"update\">Update 23 May: Most of Brian's photos taken on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/agorilla/archives/date-taken/2006/05/20/\">the 20th</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/agorilla/archives/date-taken/2006/05/21/\">the 21st</a> plus my dad's from <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/geoff0522/archives/date-taken/2006/05/20/\">the 20th</a> are of the move and related activities.</p>\n\n<small>[1]: I realize this is a set which is almost certainly mutually exclusive with the readers of this blog.</small>\n",

My favorite point: \"Of course, I expect the Internet to brim over with toilet humor; that is what the Internet is for. But the Internet is not real life. They've already proven this in a variety of ways related to Nintendo product announcements. Remember the almost universal outpouring of disdain following the announcement of the Nintendo DS? Nintendogs?\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"update\">Update 1 May: First mentioned to me by my dad, the theory that \"Wii\" is a fake name has become somewhat of a dull roar on the Internet.  <a href=\"http://www.tgdaily.com/2006/04/29/a_wii_bit_more_attention_for_nintendo/\">The theory</a> is simultaneously ridiculous and enticing.  Or is it just wishful thinking?  If Nintendo changed the name at E3, would it be perceived as giving into pressure as <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2006/01/16/playstation-3-conceptual-design/\">Sony</a> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/22/sony-confirms-ps3-controller-redesign/\">has</a> with just about all of the PS3's design?

Also, I decided that I was calculating from the wrong direction.  Knowing (almost) all of the outcome values and probabilities, it should be easy to setup an equation for the value of the average ticket and solve for when that value equals one dollar.  It was easy:</p>\n\n<p class=\"update\" style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/39/100409319_619a6f906c_o.png\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"update\">So when the pocket value of the jackpot is over $117 million, a ticket is worth more than it costs.  The pocket value is equal to the inflation-corrected post-taxes estimate we made above (about 46.117% of the advertised estimation).  An estimated jackpot of about <strong>$254 million</strong> would satisfy these conditions.  No one won last night, and they're advertising above $360 million for Saturday.</p>\n",

Each book had become a little less strong than the last, and although I was still interested in the story, I was worried it was going to end badly.  I was wrong.  The finale literally moved me to tears.  It was absolutely amazing.  Another thing: In the original Ender Series, Card has this habit of introducing a new planet based on a single country (the Portuguese Planet, and later the Chinese Planet).  It seemed really silly at the time, but he explains it well here, and is able to show the same deep understanding of different societies in these books without it seeming quite as clumsy.  Looking back, this was (by far) the better series.</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

And he posts quite regularly.\n\nThe other day, he <a href=\"http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/intelligent_des.html\">posted about</a> the Evolution versus Intelligent Design debate.  He didn't debate the issue, mind you (he says \"Iâ€™m not a believer in Intelligent Design, Creationism, Darwinism, free will, non-monetary compensation, or anything else I canâ€™t eat if I try hard enough\"), he decided instead to discuss the discussion.\n\n<!--more-->As if that wasn't meta enough, he focused on how both sides of the debate mischaracterize the other side's arguments.  As I was reading it, I thought \"man, he's not doing a very good job here; I've never heard <em>any</em> of these points that he's complaining about.\"  And then I realized that was the whole point.  He was either using his own misrepresentation as a meta-joke, or he was just interested in stirring up trouble.  Or probably both.\n\nHe then got 300 angry comments from both sides.\n\nToday, Scott <a href=\"http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/intelligent_des_1.html\">posted a follow-up</a>.  He essentially verified my theory, but apparently he had taken it a step further.  \"I was waiting to see how many people fell into the irony trap and misrepresented my blog entry and then attacked it.\"  <i>(The answer is \"a lot\".)</i>  He links to one blog post in particular, but the page is currently down.  He reiterates his point, and at the end leaves the whole thing open for more recursive <a href=\"http://www.fallacyfiles.org/strawman.html\">straw men</a>.\n\nI applaud his willingness to be stung by hornets just for the sake of a joke.  But what's more amazing is that, in the end, his joke was proven <em>correct</em> by those who were trying to refute it.  It's also more than a little disturbing.  Can't we engage in intelligent dialogue anymore?\n",

So here's what I had to do to get Gimp installed and working on RHEL3.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You'll need some Red Hat packages installed.  XFree86-devel, libart, and libart-devel are necessary, and you'll probably want some image libraries, too.  I installed libjpeg, libpng, and libtiff, along with their respective -devel packages.</li>\n<li>Set environment variables PATH should include /install/dir/bin, LD_LIBRARY_PATH should include /install/dir/lib, and PKG_CONFIG_PATH should include both /install/dir/lib/pkgconfig and /usr/lib/pkgconfig.  Don't use /usr or /usr/local as your install dir.  Who knows how these updated libraries could affect things if they clobber the older versions.  I installed in /opt/gimp.</li>\n<li>Get the sources for pkg-config, glib, fontconfig, freetype2, ATK, cairo, pango, GTK, Gimp.  Links are located on the <a href=\"http://www.gimp.org/source/\">GIMP from Source</a> page, except for cairo which is available from <a href=\"http://cairographics.org/download\">cairographics.org</a>.  I got the most recent version of all of these libraries <em>except for freetype2</em>.  Version 2.1.10 will cause some problems that I haven't resolved, so I used 2.1.7.</li>\n<li>Unpack all of the sources, and compile them in this order: pkg-config, glib, fontconfig, freetype2, ATK, cairo, pango, GTK, Gimp.  (This was the hard part, figuring out the right order.)  For each package, just add the argument \"--prefix=/install/dir\" to configure.  Then make and make install.  No other flags are necessary.</li>\n<li>Gimp will be in /opt/gimp/bin/gimp.  Delete the source files.</li>\n</ol>\n",

It <a href=\"http://docs.sun.com/source/819-2389/dev.html#marker-1027136\">now has</a> Linux support for USB devices connected to the thin clients.  Instead of being kernel-level, this support is user-level &mdash; in the form of a modified <a href=\"http://libusb.sourceforge.net/\">libusb</a>.  Unfortunately, roughly 97% of applications expect kernel devices, and thus lack support for libusb.  Luckily, <a href=\"http://www.pilot-link.org/\">pilot-link</a> belongs to the minority.  The following are my (roughly chronological) notes on getting a Palm (in the form of an old Handspring Visor) to sync with my Sun Ray.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You'll need to have libusb 0.1.8 or newer installed.  For reference, RHEL3 doesn't have a new enough version; I needed to find a non-standard RPM.</li>\n<li>Get the latest version of pilot-link from <a href=\"http://www.pilot-link.org/\">http://www.pilot-link.org/</a>.  I used 0.12.0-pre4.  You'll almost certainly need to compile it, since even if your distro has a package for it, it probably won't be compiled with libusb support.</li>\n<li>Be sure to add the --enable-libusb flag when you run configure for pilot-link.  (I assume the reader knows how to compile and install stuff under Linux)</li>\n<li>When you run commands that you want to use the Sun Ray libusb support, you need to run them with the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to include \"/opt/SUNWut/lib/libusbut.so.1\".</li>\n<li>I'm not sure what most of the executables that pilot-link installs do, but I know the important one is pilot-xfer.  This command line works for me: <code>bin/pilot-xfer --port usb: -s $HOME/.pilot-link</code>\nThis command will fail unless you have the Palm already trying to sync.  You'll also need to run it as root, although the pilot-link guys <a href=\"http://www.pilot-link.org/README.usb\">say</a> they're working on a fix for that.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm still on the hunt for something that will allow me to access data on a USB thumb drive.</p>\n",

But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</i>\" -- <a href=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=Matthew%205:43-48;&version=31;\">Matthew 5:43-48</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That's an insightful passage that everyone could learn from.

				"title": "Cisco IP phone custom rings",
				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday, I was surfing through the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;24&rdquo; tag on del.icio.us<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when I found a site that had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the ring that CTU uses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in several formats.  After I remembered that I have the exact <!-- raw HTML omitted -->same phone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at work, I decided to see if I could get this ring on my desk phone.</p>\n<p>The first step was to figure out if this was even possible.  There are a number of rings already on the phones at work, and they&rsquo;re apparently fairly programmable, so I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when a couple quick searches led me to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a document<!-- raw HTML omitted --> explaining how to make custom rings for the Cisco IP phone model 7960.  The file format requirements at the bottom were a little challenging, though.  I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do about &ldquo;uLaw compression&rdquo; or &ldquo;Raw PCM&rdquo;, But I figured it probably wasn&rsquo;t going to be extremely hard.</p>\n<p>Half an hour later, I had two free applications: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wavetools<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &ldquo;a library consisting of 8 programs for manipulating mono WAV files&rdquo; that let me resample the file to 8000 Hz and cut it to 16080 samples (the maximum length), and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AFsp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which then converted it to a raw PCM.  When all was said and done, I had my ringtone in the right format.  I only hoped that it still sounded right.</p>\n<p>The next step was less technological and more political, and I wasn&rsquo;t kidding myself into thinking it would be easy.  The Cisco IP phones use a centralized server to get their configuration information, firmware, and (apparently) ringtones.  I sent an email to Paul the phone guy, asking him if it would be a big deal.  As I expected, he referred me to a middle-manager, but luckily I knew him pretty well.  I asked him if it would be possible, and at first he seemed receptive, but he started to realize that it might be setting a bad precedent. I could only imagine how many people would want to have their own ringtones on there, and chances are they wouldn&rsquo;t have the skills to convert it to the exactly right format.</p>\n<p>I was concerned that this was the end of my 24 ringtone story.  I emailed the PCM and the link to the author of the original page, telling him that it was untested but that I was confident it was right.  Then I went home.</p>\n<p>The next morning, in the shower (as if you doubted it), I realized: the phones just use <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->TFTP<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get all of the stuff from the server.  TFTP servers are, well, trivial to set up.  In fact, I know of at least one of our servers at work that&rsquo;s currently running a TFTP daemon.

				"content_text": "Yesterday, I was surfing through the <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/tag/%2224%22\">\"24\" tag on del.icio.us</a> when I found a site that had <a href=\"http://www.ccir.ed.ac.uk/~jad/ringtone.html\">the ring that CTU uses</a> in several formats.  After I remembered that I have the exact <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/phones/ps379/ps1855/\">same phone</a> at work, I decided to see if I could get this ring on my desk phone.\n<!--more-->\nThe first step was to figure out if this was even possible.  There are a number of rings already on the phones at work, and they're apparently fairly programmable, so I wasn't surprised when a couple quick searches led me to <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps556/products_administration_guide_chapter09186a00800c2fa1.html\">a document</a> explaining how to make custom rings for the Cisco IP phone model 7960.  The file format requirements at the bottom were a little challenging, though.  I wasn't sure what to do about \"uLaw compression\" or \"Raw PCM\", But I figured it probably wasn't going to be extremely hard.\n\nHalf an hour later, I had two free applications: <a href=\"http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/wavetools.html\">wavetools</a>, \"a library consisting of 8 programs for manipulating mono WAV files\" that let me resample the file to 8000 Hz and cut it to 16080 samples (the maximum length), and <a href=\"http://www.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/MMSP/Documents/Software/Packages/AFsp/AFsp.html\">AFsp</a>, which then converted it to a raw PCM.  When all was said and done, I had my ringtone in the right format.  I only hoped that it still sounded right.\n\nThe next step was less technological and more political, and I wasn't kidding myself into thinking it would be easy.  The Cisco IP phones use a centralized server to get their configuration information, firmware, and (apparently) ringtones.  I sent an email to Paul the phone guy, asking him if it would be a big deal.  As I expected, he referred me to a middle-manager, but luckily I knew him pretty well.  I asked him if it would be possible, and at first he seemed receptive, but he started to realize that it might be setting a bad precedent. I could only imagine how many people would want to have their own ringtones on there, and chances are they wouldn't have the skills to convert it to the exactly right format.\n\nI was concerned that this was the end of my 24 ringtone story.  I emailed the PCM and the link to the author of the original page, telling him that it was untested but that I was confident it was right.  Then I went home.\n\nThe next morning, in the shower (as if you doubted it), I realized: the phones just use <acronym title=\"Trivial File Transfer Protocol\"><a href=\"http://www.javvin.com/protocolTFTP.html\">TFTP</a></acronym> to get all of the stuff from the server.  TFTP servers are, well, trivial to set up.  In fact, I know of at least one of our servers at work that's currently running a TFTP daemon.  The hard part was telling the phone to use a TFTP server other than the one that it was told to use:\n\n<ol><li>Go to Settings -> Network Configuration</li><li>Hit \"* * #\".  Nothing will happen, but you've just made the settings editable.</li><li>Find the \"Alternate TFTP\" setting.  On my phone it's #32.  Set it to \"Yes\" by hitting the appropriate soft button.</li><li>Go back up to the \"TFTP Server 1\" setting (#8 on my phone), and hit the \"Edit\" soft button</li><li>Write down the current TFTP server.  We'll need it later, and you should probably store it in a safe place, just in case something dies sometime down the road.</li><li>Type in your <em>new</em> TFTP server IP.</li><li>Save the changes.</li></ol>\n\nNow, it was just a matter of figuring out what files I needed to get from the old TFTP server.  I started my new server with verbosity turned way up, and rebooted the phone (well, I unplugged it and plugged it back in).  When the phone requested files, I saw them in the log.  I then used a TFTP client program to download them from the old server.  I modified the RingList.xml and added my raw PCM to the directory, and rebooted my phone again.\n\nWhen it came up, the ring was on the phone and looked and sounded just like any other ring.\n",

The heart is in the right place -- to a certain extent -- but it messes up some characters and it throws a huge monkey wrench into the pre-Empire timeline.  But, I did get a kick out of the references to his stories.  I can think of three off the top of my head.  (<em>Warning: Spoilers ahead.</em>)</p>\n<!--more-->\n<ol>\n<li>Near the beginning of the movie, Dr. Calvin and Detective Spooner are trying to find the \"malfunctioning NS-5\" in a warehouse of 1000 other non-malfunctioning but otherwise identical NS-5's.  In the <i><b>Little Lost Robot</b></i>, Calvin is trying to sort a robot with a modified First Law from a group of otherwise identical robots.  Her proposal in the movie - interviewing each robot and correlating their responses - is what she first tries in the story.  Even more amazing, the model number for the robots in the short story is NS-2.</li>\n<li>Sonny's dreaming, and the dream itself, are taken almost verbatim from the story <i><b>Robot Dreams</b></i>.</li>\n<li>Viki's interpretation of the three Laws (and thus the very climax of the movie) is very similar to R. Daneel Olivaw's development of a Zeroth Law in the <i><b>Empire</b></i> series.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Add to that the very prominent position of Dr. Susan Calvin, Alfred Lanning, and Lawrence Robertson in the movie (not to mention the Three Laws and the title itself), and you have a movie that borrowed pretty heavily from Asimov's work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"update\">Update: Damnit, IMDB's <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0343818/trivia\">trivia page</a> for I, Robot listed all three of my references.</p>\n",

I'm still interested in trying the game out on a lower-powered machine (my <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/IBM_ThinkPad_T40/4505-3121_7-20947059.html\">new laptop</a>, perhaps), since that may demonstrate the flexibility of the engine.  But when you compare it to Doom 3 and Far Cry, they're visually all very comparable.</li>\n<li>The <em>physics engine</em> on the other hand is <strong>far</strong> better done than I was expecting.  It's so amazingly pervasive.  My single complaint is that you can't use the gravity gun (even the 'push' mode) on corpses.</li>\n<li>I'm three or four hours in (past Ravenholm, driving down the coast in a dune buggy), and I'm not 100% clear on what the story is.  What the hell am I doing?  I mean, I know my current task, which I won't expand on for fears of spoilering, but I don't know the whole point of what I'm doing in Half-Life-land.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, that doesn't keep it from being a ridiculously fun game.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have other thoughts, but they aren't important.  This game is great.  Steam worked perfectly.  I wonder when the first mods will start coming out..</p>\n",

That does not mean that HL2 will be out immediately thereafter. Vivendi will still have to approve the RC, a process that could take another two or three weeks, depending on their QA department and how fit the RC is to be released. If it were rejected, Valve would have to cook up another one and submit that for approval. Once an RC is approved, we should get a \"gone gold\" announcement. Those of you who preloaded HL2 and intend to buy it online would *may* be allowed to purchase it shortly afterward and start playing it once you've downloaded the last few files (I'm still not certain whether Valve contractually obliged to wait until it's on the shelves - I don't have Fragmaster's psychic spy network). For those of you still intending to buy a physical copy, it would be at least another few weeks before the game hit the shelves; duplication, packaging and shipping take a while.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The \"RC on September 15\" information comes from <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/09/03/news_6106680.html\">this Gamespot story</a>.</p>\n",

All of the interaction between players is at a single moment, and the scoring can be easily automated.

				"content_text": "Boggle is arguably one of the best candidates for a simple online multiplayer game.  All of the interaction between players is at a single moment, and the scoring can be easily automated.  JavaScript with DOM allows you to do a lot of really neat things, so as a test of my skills, I decided to try to make a massively multiplayer online Boggle game.  It worked, but my backend code was pretty inefficient.  When I brought it down, Evan offered to mirror it.  He's not only done that, but he's improved the game beyond even my plans.  <a href=\"http://weboggle.shackworks.com/\">Check out the game</a>.\n<!--more-->\n<h4>Motivation</h4>\n\nAround the the end of January, I was doing some reading for work on the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/DOM/\">Document Object Model</a> (DOM).  The DOM (ideally) allows JavaScript to access and modify any element in an HTML document in a heirarchical Object-Oriented fashion (well, as OO as Javascript can ever be).  The more I read about what was possible, the more I realized that I could create a totally interactive application written in merely HTML and JavaScript.\n\nThen I remembered what I think is the most useful JavaScript feature in existance: asyncronous HTTP requests using the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/xmlsdk30/htm/xmobjxmlhttprequest.asp\">XMLHTTP object</a> for Internet Explorer or the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/xmlextras/\">XMLHttpRequest</a> object in Mozilla-based browsers.  Using this object and a little server-side scripting, I could not only keep important logic and large files like dictionaries on the server, but I could also create multiplayer (potentially <em>massively</em> multiplayer) interactive online games that required nothing but a modern browser.\n\nThink about <a href=\"http://www.popcap.com/\">PopCap</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pogo.com/\">Pogo</a>, <a href=\"http://games.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo Games</a>, and <a href=\"http://zone.msn.com/\">MSN Games</a>.  Every single one of the games on these sites could be done without requiring a single plugin.  I thought about it, and I decided to set about demonstrating it.  (<small>It was only after this game was mostly completed that I noticed <a href=\"http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/SSCrabble/\">SSCrabble</a>.  While it uses similar client-side scripting techniques, it lacks the multiplayer functionality entirely, which is too bad.</small>)\n\n<h4>Technology</h4>\n\nWEBoggle is primarily HTML and JavaScript.  There's fewer than 100 server-side lines of Perl, and a 90,000 word dictionary.\n\nAll WEBoggle requires is either Internet Explorer 5 or newer, or a Mozilla-based browser like <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/\">Firebird</a> or <a href=\"http://galeon.sourceforge.net/\">Galeon</a>.  (<small>Internet Explorer 4 <em>should</em> work, but I've never tried it.</small>).  There are a few caveats, and good reasons why other common browsers like Opera do not work, but those are all listed in the Bugs section below.  Also, your browser must accept cookies.  Sorry.\n\n<h4>Cheating</h4>\n\nCheating in an online game is an inherent problem.  I've worked as hard as I could in order to keep important scoring logic server-side in WEBoggle.  I'm only human, and it's possible that I've missed something and it's possible to modify the JavaScript source code so that it submits invalid words and they get erroneously scored.\n\nA much easier way to cheat, however, is to write a script to give you all of the words that can be found on the board.  I could have made it more difficult to do this, but as long as the letters are legible to the player, you could simply type them into a command line script that would then give you a list of words to type back into the game.  There was simply no way to prevent this. (<small>I wrote such a script in about 60 seconds, so if you're considering it, your effort won't make you \"the first\".  I was able to get more than 50 points consistantly.</small>)\n\nI just hope that everyone who plays this game remembers that cheating is no fun, not for you, and not for anyone with whom you're playing..\n\n<h4>Updates</h4>\n\nOnce WEBoggle started generating several thousand player-games per day, it started interfering with the operation of the sites on <a href=\"http://www.discordians.net\">my webhost</a>.  I took it down until I could make it more efficient, and a guy named Evan Simpson came forward with an offer to mirror it for the time being.\n\nAs anyone who's seen my <a href=\"/projects/\">Projects listing</a> will agree, I have a short attention span.

You can then right click and download it.\n\nJust drag this link to your bookmark toolbar: <a href=\"javascript:o=document.getElementsByTagName('object');for(i=0;i<o.length;++i){var b,h,j,c=o[i].childNodes;for(j=0;j<c.length;++j){var d=o[i].childNodes[j],t=String(d.tagName).toLowerCase(),n=String(d.name).toLowerCase(); if(t=='param'&&(n=='href'||(n=='src'&&!h)))h=d.value;}if(h){b=document.createElement('a');b.href=h;b.innerHTML=h;o[i].parentNode.replaceChild(b,o[i]);}} void 0;\">Objects to links</a>\n\nNote: right now this doesn't work at the most useful location: <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/\">Apple Trailers</a>.  They use some funky quicktime forwarding stuff.  I'm working on a solution.\n",
